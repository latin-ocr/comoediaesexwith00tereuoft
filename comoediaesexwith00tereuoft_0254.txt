Acr Ι. ScuNE 11. Clitipho, son of
Chremes, is just coming out of his father’s
house, and as he comes he warns his friend
Clinia not to be uneasy, for that they will
soon return from the city, with his mistress.
Chremes comes up in time to hear thus
much; and his son informs him of the state
of affairs in his house. Clinia the lost son
of Menedemus has returned home. He
had met him as he was disembarking, and
had brought him home to dinner. ‘Ah,'
says Chremes, ⁴ how I wish Menedemus
were here now 3 and now I think of it I will
send for him at once.' ‘By no means,'
answers his son, ‘ for Clinia is in a state of
the greatest despair, and might probably be
driven away again, if he heard that his
father was coming! Chremes is about
to explain the real state of Menedemus’
feelings; but he restrains himself, thinking
that it is better for 311 parties that the young
man s’hould be kept 3 little longer in a state
of wholesome alarm3 and he justifies Me-
nedemus to his son, showing that all his
strictness and that ¹of other parents in simi-
lar circumstances 311505 from 3 desire to

promote the real happiness of their sons.
He had better therefore take warning by
his friend’s example.

The Metre is as follows,—vv. 1. 3, trochaic
tetrameter-3 2. 5, 6. 13, trochaic tetrameter
catalectic; 4, trochaic dimeter catalecti03
7—12. 14-37, iambic tetrameter.

l.] Clinia had seut his servant with
Syrus, Chremes’ slave, to fetch Anti-
phila from the city. He is getting anxious
about his mistress, and Clitipho here en-
deavours to reassure him. He may make

himself quite easy, for they will bebere
immediately.

11. Quam vellem . . ⁴ How 1
wish that I had pressed Menedemus more
strongly to come, that he might be with us.¹
Some connect ‘ amplius ' with ⁴ esset3' but
we have no instances of that construction,
and it is most natural to take it with ⁸ invi-
tatum.' Menedemus had been already in-
vited3 but Chremes now thinks that he
might have pressed him more strongly to

come. For ‘ cave faxis' see note on An-
dria iv. 4. 12.
