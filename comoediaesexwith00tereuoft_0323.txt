adopted it into the ‘Adelphi.’ and repro-

So here Terence congratulata himself on
having recovered a scene which Plautus had
omitted, by having gone over the seme
ground csrefully for himself. For ‘ pernos-
cite ' see note on Andria, Prolog. 24. ‘ Ne-
gligentis ’ probably means here simple negli-
gence· Plautus may very possibly have
omitted the opening scene of the play of
Diphilus, end contented himself with giving
s sketch of the facts in his Pmlogue. It is
the seme kind ofnegligence which is spoken
of in the Prologue ιο the Andria. vv. 20. 81.
where the word particularly refers to the
practice of mixing two plays, which in-
volzed of course the omission of parts of

latest accusation which hed been brought

it may be sufficient to repent in this place.
