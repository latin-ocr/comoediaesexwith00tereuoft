32. Quicum illa consuevit prius ?] ‘ But
what do you think will be the feelings of
the unfortunate man, with whom she had
lived before?' This use of ‘consuesco'
occurs again in Hecyra iv. 1. 40:

“Nam si is posset ab ea se derepente
avellere
Quacum tot consuesset annos, non eum
hominem ducerem.”

It is best to take ‘illa’ as the nominative
case, and to read ‘ quicum! Some editions
omit ‘ cum,' aud take ⁸ qui ' as the ablative;
but we do not find ‘ consuesco ' in that con-
struction. The idea of ⁴ consuesco' is to
become accustomed to a person or thing.
Hence, of wild animals, ‘ to become tame,’
as in Plautus, Asinaria i. 3. 69, where lovers
are spoken of as wild birds:

‘⁴ Bene salutando consuescunt, compellando
Ostdiiliiiiiltgt'bratione vinnula, venustula.'’

37. Auctor Ιιίε rebus quia est ?] ‘ Who
gave his consent to your proceedings ?’ Who
gave you leave to enter into a marriage en-
gagement? ‘Auctor’ is of very wide ap-
plication, and is used in a variety of senses.
See note on Andria, Prolog. 18.

38. Cur duxit alienam ι’] Donatus finds
a difficulty in these words, and says, ‘⁶ Utrum
filiam? Quae possit aliena esse? Nam

omnes alienas filias ducunt ?” The idea is

Mi. Aeschine,

that Pamphila as an orphan belonged to her

next of kin, and thus was already another ,

man's wife virtually, when Aeschinus took
her.

39. Dum coynatus hinc illinc veniret]
⁴ Ought the girl to have remained sitting
at home when she was grown up, waiting
for a relation to turn up from somewhere m·
other ?’ ⁴ Hinc illinc ' was Donatus' read-
ing, and is that of many old editions. ⁴ Huc
illinc,' which is the reading of some editions,
gives too precise a sense, as Bentley re-
marks, and would imply that a relation was
expected to come from some definite place,
whereas the object of Aeschinus is to throw
doubt on the existence of this relation al·
together. ‘ This,’ he says, ‘is what you
ought to have said, and what you ought to
have maintained! Perlet considers ‘ defen-
dere ' to mean ‘ cohibere ne cognatus illam
abduceret.' But ‘ defendo ' is always used,
when applied to argument, in the sense of
¹ to assert,' ⁴ to maintain! See Cicero, De
Oratore ii. 38: “Qui (Carneades) nullam
unquam in illis suis disputationibus rem
defendit quam non probarit; nullam oppug-
navit quam non everterit.'' Aeschinus is
made in his vehemence to repeat himself.
The two clauses are the same in substance,
though different in form. ⁶ Haec’ refers to
the words used, ‘id' to the matter of the
argument.
