begun to cool down.' The original mean-
ing of ⁴ deferveo ' is ‘ to cease boiling,’ to
be past the boiling pitch. ‘ De ’ in compo-
sition, like the Greek ἀπὸ, has sometimes
this sense, as in Virgil‚ Aeneid x. 809:

“ Aeneas nubem belli dum detonet omnem
Sustulit.”

Horace, Carm. i. 9. 10:

“ Stravere ventos aequore fervido
Depraeliantes‚' ’

which seems to be a Graecism for ‘ stravere
ventos ita ut depraelient,' though there are
many who explain it by ‘ valde praeliantes‚'
ἀπομαχομένους. Both ἀπὸ and ⁶ de ' have
the sense of finality, and so they sometimes
signify in composition ‘ to end an act,'
sometimes ⁴ to an aet out to its end!
In some words, as in ‘deferveo,' we have
both meanings (see Forcellini).

Aer II. Scnrm 1. Aeschinus had broken
into Sannio's house and carried off a music
girl. He has now-brought her to his own
house; where he has been followed by San-
nio, who calls loudly on all the lieges to

help him against this violent young fellow.
Ile threatens to snatch the girl from Aes-
chinus3 and also threatens legal proceed-
ings against him for assault and battery.
Aeschinus replies by putting Parmeno as a
sentry over him with directions to give him
a good thrashing if he stirs a finger3 and
announces to Sannio his determination to
keep the girl at all hazards. If he will sell
the girl at eost price, well and good3 if not,
he will claim her as a free citizen ; so he may
choose which he likes best. Sannio comes
to the conclusion that he had better pocket
his thrashing, and try to get the money.
But there is the rub. Aeschinus is sure
not to give it, and the unfortunate master
will be the loser.

The Metre is as follows; 1—— 3. 6. 8. ll,
trochaic tetrameter3 7. 9, 10. 12-16.
43-54, trochaic tetrameter catalecti03 4,
iambic dimeter; 5. 17—42, iambic tetra-
meter.

2. Otiose . . consiste] ‘ Stand still now
here on the spot at your ease, why do you
look behind you ?' Aeschinus is speaking
to the girl whom he has brought with him
from Sannio's house, and who is afraid that
she will be seized and carried of by her
owner. ‘Respecto’ is to look back fre-
quently in a frightened manner. ἀποβλέ-
