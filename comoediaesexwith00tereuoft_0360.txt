natus this short scene was wanting in some
copies of Terence3 and in consequence
Guyetus rejected it altogether. But it
seems entitled to stand where it is. Hegio
had gone to see Sostrata (v. 61 of Scene 4),
and is now leaving 1101· 1101100, and speaking
to her as hc goes out, a not uncommon
scenio arrangement with Terence. (See
Andria iii. 3, and Heaut. v. 1.) The words,
too, ‘⁴ Ego Micionem, si apud forum est, Con-
veniam‚'’ connect this scene with iv. 3,
where Hegio and Micio appear together3
and this 000110 seems to have been intro-
duced for the sole purpose of forming a link
between the last scene and iv. 3, otherwise
what is said here might, as Colman says,
have been better said behind the scene.
The Men-e is iambic trimeter.

:Aer IV. Suana Ι. Syrus had sent De-
mea, as 110 supposed, safely off to his farm,
and made him believe that Ctesipho was
there. Ctesipho is new alai-med at the con-
sequeneea of this trick. If his father does
not find him, 110 will be sure to come back
to town to look for him; and that farm is
so nearthat 110 ean be out and back again
in no time. And if he comes, what is he to
say? ‘Any thing‚’ says Syrus, ‘you have
been busy with some friend! But that
won't do for my being here all night.
⁴ Never mind,' says Syrus, ¹ 1 know the way

to his heart. Ι have only got to praise you
pretty strongly, and the old man <avios for
joy. But here heis. Get out of the way
with you; and leave it to me!

The Metre is as follows ;“ l. 9, trochaic
tetrameter; 2. 10, trochaic tetrameter 0010-
10011ος 8, trochaic dimeter oetalectic. The
remaining lines are iambic tetrameter.

1. Dic sodes] For this phrase see 11010
011 Andria i. l. 58. ‘ Your father) says
Syrus, ‘is at the farm3 and 1 fancy that
just about now he is hard at work at some-
thing or other.' For the expression ‘ opus
facere’ compare Eunuchus ii. 1. 14: ‘⁴ Opus
faciam 111 defatiger usque ingratiis ut dor-
miam.’⁷

5. Ita fiat, et istoc si quid potis eut rec·
tius] Commentators notice the mhiguity
of these words, supposing Syrus to hint a
wish for the old man’s death, which would
rid them of him more effectually than ever.
Ctesipho seems to take it as a kind of addi-
tion to his own wish. He had said, ‘As
long as he does not injure his health, 1 wish
he would so utterly tire himself, as not to
be able 10 get out of bed for the whole of
the next three days.¹ ‘ Yes,' says Syrus,
‘ and any thing that can happen better than
that! Ctesipho clearly does not take Syrus'
inuend03 for if he did, as Donatus observes,
he would not say ‘ Yes! He considers
Syrus to wish that his father might be kept
