494 TERENOE AND THE NEW GOMEDY.

quoting. It has already been noticed in the Introduction to the ‘Eunu-
chus ’ that the characters of Thraso and Gnatho are in a great degree
different from the stock idea of the Bully and the Toady. vIt is in-
teresting to observe that in the following passage, which is distinctly
ascribed to the Κόλαξ of Menander, the grosser traits of the character of
the Braggadocio appear. He is made to say:

 

Κοτύλας χωροῦν δέκα
ἐν Καππαδοκίᾳ κόνδυ χρυσοῦν, Στρουθία,

τρὶς ἐξέπιον μεστόν γ’. ΣΤ. Ἀλεξάνδρου πλέον
τοῦ βασιλέως πέπωκας. Β. Οὐκ ἔλαττον, οὔ,

μὰ τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν. ΣΤ. Μέγα γε. (Κόλ. Fragm. i.)

In a passage of Suidas, ii. p. 327, quoted by Meineke, the Struthias,
of Menander is classed with the old-fashioned parasites‚ such as appear
in the plays of Plautus. Οἱ Ἕλληνες Κλεισόφους τε ᾄδουσι καὶ Θήρωνας
καὶ Στρουθίας καὶ Χαιρεφῶντας, ἀνθρώπους ἐσθίειν εἰδότας εἷς κόρον καὶ
δεινοὺς γαστέρα. This broad sensual trait is suppressed in Terence’s
adaptation3 though we find the same tendency to exaggerated flattery
throughout.

In the following passage of the ‘ Eunuchus,’ where Parmeno presents
the gifts of Phaedria, 110 speaks of his master thus:

“ Atque haec qui misit non sibi soli postulat
Te vivere, et sua causa excludi caeteros;
Neque pugnas narrat3 neque cicatrices suas
Ostentat3 neque tibi obstat, quod quidam facit.”
(Eunuch. iii. 2.·2'7—30.)

We find a counterpart to these lines in the following fragment of an
unknown play of Phoenicides. Doubtless the idea was a common one3
but it is here expressed in a manner very similar to that of Terence. A
courtezan is expressing her determination to abandon her profession.
It has been a failure.

Μὰ τὴν Ἀφροδίτην οὐκ ἂν ὑπομείναιμ’ ἔτι,
Πυθιάς, ἑταιρεῖν· χαιρέτω· μή μοι λέγε.

ἀπέτυχον· οῦδὲν πρὸς ε’μέ· καταλῦσαι θέλω.

And she goes on to give an account of the various experiences she has
had with her lovers. The first was a ‘ miles'gloriosus!

Εὐθὺς ἐπιχειρήσασα φίλον εἶχόν τινα
στρατιωτικόν· διαπαντὸς οὗτος τὰς μάχας
ἔλεγεν, ε’δείκνΰ ἅμα λέγων τὰ τραύματα,

εἰσέφερε δ’ οὖὸέν· δωρεὰν ἔφη τινὰ
