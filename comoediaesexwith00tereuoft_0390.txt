9. Hymenaeum San] A long note might
be written to illustrate each of these words.
But the student is referred to the Dictionary
of Antiquities for a full account of all the
ceremonies of marriage, which would be out
of place here. See note on Andria ii. 2.

10. Maceriam] This is the only place in
Terence or Plautus where this word occurs.
‘ Maceria’ properly means ⁸ a boundary
wall' enclosing a piece of ground. The
term was confined to what we call a wall,
in distinction from a fence, made of stones,

,bricks, or flints. Caesar (Bell. Gall. vii.
69) uses it apparently of a wall made in
haste of loose stones. See Long's note.
It is probably connected with ‘ macellum,'
which is derived, according to Festus, from
μάκελον or μάκελλον. See Forcellini (Ma-
cellum .

15. inulta] ‘Tbere will be much ado.'
Some editors, without authority, read
‘sumptum amittat multum ;’ but the ordi-
nary reading is quite intelligible.

17. Dinumeret illi Babylo viyinti minas]
Commentators have puzzled very much over

Sic soleo: sed eccum Micio egreditur foras.

these words. Colman’s conjecture seems to
be the most sensible: “ that Demea means
to give an· order to one pf his servants to
ἴιὲἰέἓὲῗῗὲἳθξῖῖἪέιὲῗὲξῖὲωῒῗῖἓῗὲῗ
ing the part of the generous man; and it is
in keeping with this that he is made to
make Aeschinus a handsome present on his
marriage. Others suppose that he is sar-
castically alluding to Micio, and means ι
⁴ Let him now order his steward to disburse
to Aeschinus twenty minae3 for this busi-
ness will eost him that much at least!
Donatus seems to have taken it in this way.
He says, “Nimis morale est quum de ab-
sente tanquam de praesente agimus.” ⁴ Ba-
bylo ' is more like the name of a slave than
any thing else; and it is an unnecessary re-
finement to suppose Demea to style Micio
by such a name in allusion to his sumptu·
ous extravagance; or Sannio, whom some
commentators have absurdly supposed to be
called ‘ Babylus.’ He was already paid (iii.
3. 15), and had been out of sight for some
time.
