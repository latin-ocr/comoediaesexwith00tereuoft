 

IN TRODUOTION . ³ xlix

“ Quod egodn propinqua parte amicitiae puto,” (Heaut. i. 1. 5,)
not eq’in ; part’ amicitiae.

The testimony of Quinctilian is decisive on this point. He says
especially that the words coalesced, and that this made the pronun-
ciation softer than if every word had been pronounced separately. See
ix. 3. 36. With respect to the language of Oomedy he says, “Actores
comici neque ita prorsus ut nos vulgo loquimur pronunciant, quod
esset sine arte, nec procul tamen a natura recedunt, quo vitio periret
imitatio, sed mores communis hujus sermonis decore quodam scenico
exornant’‘ (ii. 10. 13). Two objects, then, were before the actor3 to
give the ordinary pronunciation of the language; and at the same time
to mark to the audience the character of the metre. And if the common
practice in conversation was to run the words, when possible, into one
another, we may expect to find the same practice in Terence. This usage
which we call, after Quinctilian (ix. 4. 36), ‘ Synaloepha,’ is called by
Cicero ‘ Hiatus ε’ “ Habet ille quidem hiatus et concursus vocalium molle
quiddam ” (De Oratore, c. 23). But Quinctilian’s term is more
correct. ‘Hiatus' properly describes the absence of ‘Synaloepha‚’
and in this sense will be considered below. It is curious that Bentley,
in treating of this very peculiarity in the Latin pronunciation which we
are now considexing, uses the words “ Quin et ubi Synaloephae vis
cessat, et vel vocalis quaepiam vel m finales non eliduntur, altera vocali
eas excipiente, ne hoc quidem ,in licentiis ponas3 qualia ista et plura
apud nostrum: omnes qm‘ amant; ‘me' et aetate, πό ubi acceperim, quae‘
erat mortum ἀήτη id ‘zffissia-b· Quicum uno νέφη, habebam.’' He lays
down three rules for these words„ (1) They are monosyllables. (2)
If ending in a vowel, they are long. (3) They have the metrical ‘ ictus.’
In accordance with his remark most editors treat all these cases as
examples of ‘ Hiatus.’ It is better to consider them to be instances of
⁸ Synaloepha,' by which the two syllables coalesco in pronunciation, which
they cannot do in a case of real ‘ Hiatus,' for there each letter preserves
its independent weight.

'I'he following instances will serve to show the extent of this practice
in Terence: ’

“ Vide quam iniquus sis prae studio: daim id efficias qu6d cupis.'’
(And. v. 1. 6.)
