HEAUTONTIMORUMENOS.

Tum erat contenta, cuique⁴ erant grata omnia,
Proterruisti hino: ea coacta ingratiis

Postilla coepit vietum vulgo quaerere.

Nunc cum sine magno intertrimento non potest

Haberi‚ quidvis dare cupis ε nam ut tu seias

40

Quam ea nune instructa pulchre ad perniciem siet,
Primum, jam ancillas secum adduxit plus decem,

Oneratas veste atque auro.

Satrapes si siet

Amator, nunquam sufferre ejus sumtus queat;

Nedum tu possis.

Me. Estne ea intus? Oh. Sit rogas Ρ

45

Sensi: namque ei unam coenam atque ejus comitibus
’ Dedi ; quod si iterum mihi sit danda, actum siet.

Nam ut alia omittam, pytissando modo mihi

Quid vini absumsit l “ Sic hoc‚'’ dioens3 “Asperum‚

Pater, hoc est ; aliud lenius sodes vide.''

50

Relevi dolia omnia, omnes serias ;

Nam mteus scruposam victus commetat
viam.

The ordinary text has ‘ commeare‚’ but
‘ commetare ’ is required by the metre, as
Bentley pointed out.

37. Ea coacta inqratit's . . . victum vulqo
quaerere] Compare the similar passage in
Andria i. l. 47—52, where see the note on
the words ⁴ victum quaeritans‚' and for
‘ ingratiis ' see note on Eunuchus ii. l. 14.

39. Num: cum sine maqno intertrimento
non potest] ‘ Intertrimentum ⁹ is properly
the waste of metals which takes place in melt-
ing. ‘ Detrimentum' is more particularly
applied to waste in filing or rubbing. A
distinction may be drawn between the two
words: for ⁴ inter ' signifies more thorough
loss than ‘ de,’ though both prepositions are
used similarly in many compounds. ‘ In-

* tertrimentum ’ like ⁸ detrimentum’ comes

to mean simply ‘ loss‚’ ‘ damage! Compare
Cicero, In C. Verrem ii. 1. 502 ‘⁴ Cum eo
sine ullo intertrimento convenerat jam
quemadmodum traderetur.”
41. Instructo ad perniciem] ⁴ That you
may know how admirably she is now trained
to mischief! Compare Plautus, Bacchides

iii. Le:

“Bacchides nen Bacchides, sed Bacchae
sunt acerrumae.
Apage istas a me sorores quae hominum
sorbent sanguinem.
Omnis ad perniciem instructa domus
opime atque opipare,”

and the similar expression in Hecyra ii. l.
6: ‘⁴ In eodemque omnes mihi videntur
ludo doctae ad malitiam.”

48. Pytissando modo mihi quid vini
absumsit] “For not to speak of other
things, what a quantity of my wine did she
waste in tasting, saying, ‘This is only so
so: old gentlernan, this is too harsh: see
that you let us have some a little noster!
Ι had to open all my jars and casks3 we
were all kept on the alert.{’ ‘ Pytissare,’
Gr. πυτὶζειν, was to take a little wine to
taste, and then spit it out again. Per-
let quotes from Athenaeus, Deiphos. iii.
καὶ τὸν μὲν ὀξὺν οἶνον ἐκπυτίζομεν.
We have the substantive ‘pytisma' dn a
difficult passage of Juvenal, xi. 173: “ Qui
Lacedaemonium pytismate lubricat or-
bem.'' For ‘ sodes ' in the next line see
note on Andria i. 1. 58.

51. Relevi] Terence here used ‘dolis’
rather loosely: ‘amphoras ’ would be moro
correct. The ‘dolium ’ was-a much lan-ger
vessel than the ⁴ amphora,’ and was not
scaled. Only inferior wine was drunk
from the ‘dolium,’ ‘from the ‹mkss as
we should say. The ‘amphorae' were
corked, and the cork then carefully se·
eux-ed with pitch or resin, which was
necessary to exclude not only air, but

also the smoke to which they were osten ,

exposed. Hence ‘ relino' is equivalent to
our ‘ tap,' to remove the resin and then

the cork or bung. Horace describes the
process exactly:
