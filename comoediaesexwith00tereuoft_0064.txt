lviii IN TRODUOTION.

pause at the Hiatus. The sense and rhythm run on evenly. It is
possible that in the first line we ought to read ‘ quorsus,’ in which case
the accent would fall thus, saving the Hiatus:

“ Misera timeo incertum hoc quorsus accidatss’
In Eunuchus iv. 3, 23, a simple alteration would be

“ At pol ego amatores mulierum esse eo's audieram maximosl’
In Hecyra v. 1. 19, we may shift the Hiatus to volui, accenting thus :

“ Mane nondum etiam dixi id quod volui. Hic nssnc uxorem
habet.”

In this last line I have adopted above Weise's accentuation in his
Tauchnitz edition, which gives the words a better emphasis.

METRES OF TERENOE.

ΙΝ the previous sections we have seen that the chief peculiarities of
Latin pronunciation were (1) that all dissyllabic words were accented on
the first syllable (paroxytone), as were also all hyperdissyllabic words of
which the penultima was long3 and that such hyperdissyllabic words as
had a short penultima were accented on the antepenultimate (pro-
paroxytone), having in effect, when arranged in a metre, a secondary
accent on the last syllable: (2) that in accordance with the ordinary
laws of pronunciation many words in which there was an excess of un-
accented syllables were shortened in delivery so as to fall under the
ordinary laws of accentuation. Hence we should lay> down, as an essential
requisite for the study of Latin Comic Metres,· that the alternate distribu-
tion of accent determines the measure of words. Viewing the accented
“ syllables as half a measure, or, in more familiar language, half a foot, the V
remainder of the word must be considered as the other half measure.
And therefore in treating of the trochaic and iambic metres, of which
Roman Comedy is chiefly composed, we should deal with each measure
as in effect a trochaic or an iambic measure, discarding altogether, as far
as this subject is concerned‚ if we wish to speak correctly, all such*
measure as tribrachs, anapaests, dactyls, &c. A word, taken by itself,
may be a dactyl, an anapaest, or a tribrach, but, with reference to tro-
chaic and iambic verse, these names are inappropriate.
