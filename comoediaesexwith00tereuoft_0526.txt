452 PHORMIO.

Quam timeo adventus hujus quo impellat patrem. ⁷

Ge. Adibo hosce, O noster Chreme.

011. Salve, Geta.

G‘e. Venire salvum volupe est. Oh. Credo. Ge. Quid agitur? 5
Oh. Multa advenienti, ut fit, nova hic compluria. ι

Ge. Ita : de Antiphone audistin quae facta Ρ Oh. Omnia.
G'e. Tun dixeras huic Ρ facinus indignum, Chreme,

Sic circumiri.

De. Id cum hoc agebam commodum.

Ge. Nam hercle ego quoque id quidem agitans mecum sedulo

Inveni, opinor, remedium huic rei.

De. Quod remedium Ρ Ge.
Oh. Qui Phormio Ρ Ge. Is qui istam. Oh.

Mihi Phormio.
Scio.

Oh. Quid, Geta P 11
Ut abii abs te, fit forte obviam

Ge. Visum est mihi ut ejus tentarem sententiam.

Prendo hominem solum : “ Cur non,'' inquam, “ Phormio, 15
Vides inter nos sic haec potius cum bona

Ut componantur gratia quam cum mala Ρ

Herus liberalis est, et fugitans litium:

Nam caeteri quidem hercle amici omnes modo

Uno ore auctores fuere ut praecipitem hanc daret.'' 20

What will you take that my master shall
stay proceeffings, and let Phanium go her
ways quietly? If you make a fair pro-
posal, he is not the man to make any dif-
ficulty. At first Phormio made all kinds
of difficulties. He asked a talent. 1
showed him that that was unreasonable.
At last he made this proposal: Ι shall be
very glad to marry her, he sayS, if Demi-
pho will give me as much as I am about to
receive with a bride to whom Ι am already
engaged! Geta by degrees mentions the
sum of thirty minae, which Demipho
thinks preposterous3 but Chremes under-
takes to pay his whole demand, and Phor-
mio is to marry Phanium, and leave Anti-
pho free.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

5. Venire salvum volupe est] See note
on Hecyra v. 4. 17, and on ‘credo' see
note 011 i. 2. 25.

9. circumiri] ‘Asad business, Chremes,
to be cheated in this way! We find ⁴ cir-
cumeo’ in a similar sense in Plautus,
Pseudolus iii. 2‘. loa—110:

⁰⁸ Ut mihi caverem a Pseudolo servo suo
Neu fidem ei haberem; nam eum circum-
ire in hunc diem,
Ut me, si posset, muliere interverteret.''

‘ Circumveniri ' is used similarly. See For-

cellini for examples, and note 011 Hecyra,
Alter Prolog. 44. For ‘ commodum’ see
note on Eunuch. ii. 3. 51.

13. Qui Phormio ἔ] ‘What Phormio ?'
This was the first that Chremoe had heard
of him. See note 011 Eunuch. v. l. 8.
Geta explains, ‘The man by whom that
girl—,' which reminds Chremes of what he
had heard from Demipho.

16. Vides inter nos] Bentley would
read ‘Videmus‚ inter nos haec,’ but with.
out any authority. The phrase ‘cum
gratia’ occurs in Andria ii. 5. 11 ι

“ Facis ut te decet

 

Cum istuc quod postulo impetro cum ⁵

gratia.''

18. Fuyitarw litium] Tbepresent parfi-
ciple of transitive verbs, when used as an

adjective, takes a genitive of the obJeet„

Such are ‘amans reipublicae,' ‘negotii
gerens,’ ‘ patiens laborisf ‘appetens glo-
riae! If an adverb is added, the participle
takes the case of its verb. So we'should
say ‘ negotium callide gerens,' ‘ homo facile
injurias perferens! In the latter case tho
action is the predominant element; in tho
former, the tendency to the act.

20. Uno ore auctores suere] ⁸ For all
his friends in fact have just been advising
him to turn her out of doors! ⁴ Auetor’
