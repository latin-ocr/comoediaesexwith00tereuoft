Acr IV. Scmm VIII. Menedemus is
now thoronghly happy at having recovered
his son; and not only so, but at finding
him ready to settle himself and marry. In
this mood he comes to seek Chremes, and
at once begs him to make him happy and
secure his son to him by giving him his
daughter in marriage. Chremes explains
to him that all this pretended reformation
and this wish for a wife is a trick which he
had long foreseen made up on purpose to
trick him out of his money ς and as for Bac-
chis being Clitipho's mistress, he might be-
lieve as much of that as he liked. ⁶ Ah,' says
Menedemus, ‘how 1 have been deceived!
But yet Ι had rather be deceived and suffer
any thing than lose my son again, and so
what shall 1 tell him that he may not be

² annoyed ?' ‘Tell him any thing you like,'

says Chremes: ‘say I agree to your pro-
posal ς for then you will lose your money all
the sooner, and you will very soon, I fancy,
be tired of that son of yours.'

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

5. Cedo quid vis faciam ?] ‘Say‚ what
do you wish me to do ?’ The word ⁴ cedo ’
occurs only as an imperative. It is fre-
quently, used by Terence, Plautus, and
Cicero. It is used either absolutely in the
sense of ‘tell me,' as in the present passage
and many others 3 or with an accusative, in
its original meaning ‘ give me‚’ as in Cicero,
In Verrem ii. 2. 42: ‘⁶ Cedo, quaeso, codi-
cem.’' Plautus, Mostellaria i. 3. 150:
“ Cedo aquam manibus.'' Adelphi iii. 4.
38: ‘⁴ Postremo non negabit-5 coram ipsum
oedo.” Hecyra iv. 4. 86: “ Pnerum, Phi-

Me. Quid dixti, Chreme 1> 10

dippe, mihi cedo.'’ For this transition from
the sense of ‘ give' to that of ‘tell ’ compare
the use of ‘da.' See note on Prolog. 10.
In the latter sense we find ‘ cedo ' used with
plural nouns. ‘⁴ Cedo qui vestram rem pub-
licam amisistis tam cito ?” Cicero, Cato
Major 6. But in the former we find the
form ‘ cette,’ contr-acted from ‘ oedite,' as in
Plautus, Mercator v. 4. 4: ‘⁸ Cette dextras
nunc jam.’'

7. Quaeso quid tu hominis ee ?] See notes
on Eunuchus iii. 2. 13, and iii. 4. 8.

10. Ea res nunc ayitur ipsa] This pas-
sage has given more trouble than almost
any other in Terence, in consequence of
the variation of the manuscripts. In many
editions the speeches are so arranged as to
make sense quite hopeless. In some edi-
tions after this line there follows ‘Erravi:
res acta: quanta de spe decidi,’ which is
entirely wanting in the Vatican and Bem-
bine manuscripts and some of the earliest
editions3 and as Bentley well remarks, in-
ter-feres with the sense: for Menedemus is
not made to discover his mistake till
Chremes has explained the whole matter.
The insertion of such a line here would
make ‘imo’ quite unmeaning. The con-
nexion of ideas is as follows: ⁶ Yon remem-
ber‚' says Chremes, ‘what we said about
the trick by which you were to be cheated
out of your money ,² well, that is what they
are after now.' ⁴ What do you say, Chremes?
You must be mistaken3 for this Bacchis
who is at my house is not Clinia’s mistress,
but Clitipho’s.’ ‘Ah, so they say,' says
Chremes, ⁴ and you believe it all‘: but it is
