Cicero lays down as the component parts
of music ‘⁴ numeri, voces, et modi'’ (De
Orat. i. 42), as we should say, ‘ the air, the
voice, and the accompaniment.' The ‘ti-
biae dextrae‚’ called also ‘incentivae,’ were
held in the right hand, and set the tune,
and answer to our ¹ treble.' They were the
smaller, and made of the middle part of the
reed. The ‘ sinistrae ’ were made of the
lower and lai-ger part, and were held in the
left hand, answering to our ‘ base! They
were also called ‘succentivae,' as playing
only the accompaniment.

‘Tibiae pares ' were two of equal size,
with the same number of stops, for the grave
Dorio measure. These were also called

ί Sarranae) ‘ Tibiae impares ⁹ were unequal
in size and stops‚ suited to the‘sharp Lydian
measure, and also called Phrygiae. The ex-
pression of the text, ⁴ tibiis paribus dextris
et sinistris ' means that the play was acted
with flutes of equal size, right-handed flutes
being used in one part of the play, and left-
handed in another; the play being serio-
comic, requiring a mixture of mensures.

composed and offered to the Curule·Aediles,
and earlier than any other play of Terence.
