xlviii IN TRODUOTION.

From a comparison of all the cases of Synizesis which have come
under my observation, the following general rules seem to ariae,
which may serve as a guide to us in determining the limits of this
11661166.

1. Τ116 majority of words in which this contraction takes place are
either dissyllabic or inflectione of words dissyllabic 111 their first case.

2. Words having a medial consonant are sometimes contracted, as in
the case of ‘ habent: ‘ student: ‘jube,’ &Q from the predominance of the
vowel sound; but in the great majority of cases the medial consonant is
a liquid; and in the few cases where two consonants intervene be-
tween the vowels, one of them must be a liquid.

3. Such words are generally nouns or particles, not verbs. Ι have,
however, referred to the head of Synizesis several verbs, which are treated
by Ritschl as instances of words having a. shortened final syllable, such
as volo, jube, abi, vide, 816. For why make these words an exception to
the rule that prevails in 80 many analogous cases? We pronounce
abi = ai as naturally as pater = pere .· roqa 18 as ready a monosyllable
as domus, or socrus,

4. In many cases of synizesis the contracted word or syllable may
coalesce with a vowel, as if it were a mere vowel or diphthong. This 18
frequent in Terence with tibi, sibi, mihi, ibi, and other words, of which
instances have already been noticed in the course of this section.

II. SYNALOEPHA·

'I'he word ‘Synaloepha ' applies more particularly to those cases where
a final vowel, or syllable ending in -m, coalesces with the initial vowel of
the following word. For ‘ Elision ⁹ in our sense of the word was
unknown to the Romans3 as appears from the express testimony of
Quinctilium, x. 4. 39 : “ Atqui eadem illa litera m, quoties ultima est et
vocalem verbi sequentis ita contingit ut in eam transire possit, etiam si
scribitur, tamen parum exprimitur, ut: multum ille, et: quantwm erat3
adeo ut paene cujusdam novae literae sonum reddat. Neque enim ex-
pellitur, 8611 obscuratur, et tantum aliqua inter duas vocales velut nota

est ne ipsae coeant.’' And 80 111 1116 following lines we ought to pro-

nounce
A

“ Vos istaec intrcsEuferte3 abite· Sosia,” . (And. i. 1. 1,)
1101 intr’ aufert' abite.
