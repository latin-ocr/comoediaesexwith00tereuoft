Aeta Ludis Meyalenaihus] The Mega-
lensia or Megalesia were instituted by the
Phrygians in honour of Cybele. They were
introduced into Rome during the second
Punic War, uc. 204, when the statue of
Cybele was brought to Rome by P. Scipio
Nasioe, from the Megalensian temple, near
Pessinus in Phrygia, in obedience to an
oracle of Apollo (Livy xxix. 14). This
festival was first celebrated with the accom-
paniment of scenio games in the aedileship
of C. Atilius Serranus and L. Scribonius
Libo, nc. 193. ‘⁴ Megalesia ludos scenicos
C. Atilius Serranus, L. Scribonius Libo
Erimi fecerunt,” Livy xxxiv. 54, where see

probably settled with the poet in the first

Mozi‘oefieit] ⁴ Set the play to music,'
as we should say. The business of the
⁸ conductor ’ was to arrange the musical ac-
companiment, so that a proper emphasis
should be given to every portion of the dia-
logne. See an instructive chapter on ‘this
subject in Cicero De Oratore iii. 26. where
he speaks of the necessary change of em-
phasis in reciting plays on the stage, and
adds, “Neque id actores prius viderunt
quam ipsi poetae, quam denique illi etiam
qui fecerunt modos ς a quibus utrisque sum-
mittitur aliquid. deinde nugatum extenua-
tur, inflatum variatur, distinguitur.” Even
orators were sometimes attended by a
mnsician, as we learn from Quintilian (v.
10), who says of Gracchus the orator. “ Cui
contionanti consistens post eum musicus fis-
tula . . . modos quibusdeberet intendi minis-
trabat.” Each kind of play had its proper
accompaniment, as we see from the various
notices in the Didascaliae to the plays of
Terence. Compare on this subject Cicero,
Tusculan. Disput. i. 44. where he touches
humorously on the dolorous accompani·
ment to tragic laments. “Non intelligo‚”
he says, “quid metuat, quum tam bonos
septenarios fundat ad tibiam.''
