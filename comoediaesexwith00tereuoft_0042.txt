xxxvi IN TRODUOTION.

“ Volui quin tu in ca re mihifueris adversatrix, sestrataP
(Heaut. v. 3. 5.)

The same contraction occurs always infuerit ,· once infuisset .-

“ Nsm potitus essem ι fuisset tum illos mihi aegre aliquet dies‚”

(Phorm. i. 3. '7‚)
and infuisse .-

“ Et gratum id fuisse adversum te habeo gratiam.” · ’
(And. i. 1. 15.)

“ Aeschine audi: ne te ignarum fuisse dicas me6rum morum.'’

(Adelph. ii. 1. 6.)
Compare also Hec. iii. 5. 39.

Bitschl would exclude from contraction all inflectione of fui in which
‘ r’ occurs, except perhaps fuerunt. The preceding instances, however,
are decisive, as far as Terence is concerned, that in all cases of words in
which ‘u ’ is followed by a vowel synizesis is possible, though not uni-
versal. In all the words instanced above we have many instances of
their full pronunciation. I now pass to words in which ‘u' occurs with
some other ‘ vowel ' from which it is separated by a consonant.

 

jube. “ Viden? Video. Comprehendi jube quantum potest.’'
(Eun. v. 1. 20.)

“Atque hanc in horto maceriam jube dirui.”
(Adelph. v. ’7. 10.)

“Argentum rursum jzibe rescribi, Ph6rmio.’'
(Phorm. v. 7. 29.)

pudet. In Terence I find no instance of the monosyllabic pronuncia-
tion of ‘ pudet ’ and ‘ pudor ’ which occurs in Plautus. One such word
‚ is however thus used in Terence. In Adelphii. 1. 48 we have a line,

which both Bentley and Bitschl have endeavoured to alter in consequence
of its metrica] difficulty. It stands thus :

“ Studet per referre ; praesens absensque idem erit.’'

Here Bentley, according to his custom, considers the last syllable of
‘ studet ' to be shortened in spite of its position : Ritschl would amend
the line by omitting ‘ par? See the note. The simplest way is to con-
sider ‘ studet ’ as a monosyllable, without having recourse to any arbi-
trary change. Compare
