504 TERENOE AND THE NEW OOMEDY.

which, according to Menander, Chaerea told the tale of his adventure in
Thais’s house (see Donatus on Eun. iii. 4. 1); and probably the
character of Chremes was sostened by Terence, for we find that
Menander made it the representative of a rough countryman (see note
on Eun. iii. 1. 1). This last alteration we must attribute to Terence's
own taste, if there was any marked departure from Menander. For
we should have expected that a broad and rough character, such as
would be that of a countryman just come up to town, would have
pleased the Roman audie-nce. The introduction of Antipho is more
attributable to dramatic considerations. It is noticeable that Terence
is peculiarly free from soliloquies, and what he has are short. The
following are all the instances in his plays:

Andria, Act i. Scenes 3 and 4.

Eunuchus, Act iii. Scene 53 Act iv. Scenes 1 and 2.

Heautontimorumenos, Act ii. Scene 13 Act iv. Scene 2.

Adelphi, Act i. Scene 13 Act iii. Scene 5 ; Act iv. Scenes 4 and 63
Act v. Scene 4.

Hecyra, Act ii. Scene 33 Act iii. Scene 3.

Phormio, Act i. Scene 13 Act iv. Scene 23 Act v. Scene 4.

Menander, following the example of Euripides, probably indulged iu
long soliloquies‚ chiefly as prologues; and he was followed in this
respect far more closely by Plautus than by Terence. In the remarks on
Meineke’s First Fragment of the ‘ Colax' of Menander, I have already
observed that Terence departed considerably from the ordinary practice,
and, as we may conclude from that fragment, from the particular exam-
ple of Menander, in his treatment of the character of the Braggadocio.
(See . 494.)

, Ιηξὶιθ ‘ HEAUTONTIMORUMENOS’ we have lost the help of the com-
mentary of Donatus3 and from his substitute, Eugraphius, we gain no
information of value on the text of Menander. This play. has a more
complicated plot than any of the others; and we might easily con-
Jecture that part of this complexity is due to the introduction by
Terence either of original matter or of the plot of some other play.
But we have not even a hint upon which to argue, and a merc con-
jecture ls worse than absolute ignorance.

In his commentary on the‘ ADELPHI' Donatus mentions one or two
trifling departure-s from the original of Menander. Thus in Menander
it is a brother of Sostrata that is introduced to protect her and her
daughter. In Terence it is Hegio, her late husband’s intimate friend
(Don. on Adelphi iii. 2. 53). The author of the life of Terence
(whether he was Suetonius or Donatus) informs us that Varro pre-
ferred the exordium of Terence's play to that of Menander's.
