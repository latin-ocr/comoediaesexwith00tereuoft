Da. Hac non successit, alia aggrediemur via.
Nisi id putas, quia primo processit parum,

Non posse jam ad salutem converti hoc malum.
Pa. Imo etiam ε 113111 satis credo si advigilaveris

Ex unis geminas mihi conficies nuptias.

Da. Ego Pamphile hoc tibi pro servitio debeo,
Conari manibus pedibus noctesque et dies ;

Capitis periclum adire, dum prosim tibi:

Tuum est si quid praeter spem evenit mihi ignoscere.

Parum succedit quod ago : at facio sedulo.

Vel melius tute reperi, me missum face.

45. Deceptus sum at non defatiqatus]
This phrase is by some derived from sporting
language. In that sense we might translate:
‘ I 3111 thrown off the scent, but not dead
beat.’

51. Ηοι· tibi pro servilio debeo] ⁴ I am
bound as your slave to struggle tooth
and nail, night and day, and to run all
risks to help you. It is for you to par-
don me, if 1 am disappointed in any thing!
So the
common expression ‘ pro meo,' Adelphi
i. 1. 23. “Siciliam nobis non pro pe-
naria cella sed pro aerario fuisse‚’' Cicero,
In Verrem ii. 4. 2. ⁴ Servitium ’ is gene-
rally used collectively‚ as the slaves of
ahouse: or generally, as “Ita nunc ser-
vitium est,’' ‘ such are slaves now-a-days,’

Plautus, Cure. ii. 3. 21. The plural, how-
ever, is used. See Cicero, Pro Coel. 32. 78 =
.“ Servitia ad caedem et inflammandam
urbem incitavit.'’ Livy iii. 15: ‘⁴ Et ser-
vitiis jugum demeret.'’ See note on ii. 6. 26.

56. Me missum face] Compare v. l.
14; and Phormio v. 7. 53. Aneient com-
mentators derive the phrase from the dis-
banding of troops, as ‘⁸ missam facere legio-
nem ;” and carry on the same metaphor
to the following line, explaining ‘ restituere
locum‚' ⁴ restore my former rank! But in
both cases the more natural sense is to be
preferred. Davus says, ‘ If yo'u are discon-
tented, manage better for yourself, and have
done with me! Pamphilus replies, ‘I should
be glad to do so: but you must restore the
position in which yon found me ς’ before,

‘Pro servitio,' ‘as your slave.’

that is, he had forfeited it by consenting to
the match. In this sense ‘restituere' ob·
tained 3 special meaning in legal language,
being used of the restitutory edicts of the
praetor. See examples in Forcellini, and
Long's note on Cicero, In Verrem ii. 2.
26. The old reading of this line is “re-
stitue in quem me accepisti locum,’' as
given in the text, and is thus quoted by
Donatus. It is evidently an imitation of
the Greek attraction, and is equivalent w
‘⁴ restitue eum locum in quo me accepisti.”
Bentley’s reading, “quem a me accepisti
locum‚'' has the authority of Eugraphius‚
but is not entitled to displace the text.

58. Concrepuit . . . ostium] The doors
opened upon the stage, after the Greek
fashion‚ and it was the custom for those
who came out of a house to atrike the door
inside to warn those who might be standing
outside to step on one side. See Heaut. i.
1. 121 ι “ Sed quid crepuerunt fores Hinc a
me? Quisnam egreditur? Huc concessero,”
and Adelphi iv. 4. 27: ‘⁴ Prodit nescio
quis: concedam huc.’' The Roman doors
opened inwards. It is mentioned 35 3
peculiar privilege that Valerius Publicola
was allowed to have a house with its dom-s
opening on the street. These who knocked
from without were said ‘pulsat-e! Heaut.

was used of those who knocked the door
from within.
