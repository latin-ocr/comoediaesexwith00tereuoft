PHORMIO.

Peccandi quum ipse de se finem non facit:

Nunc quid velim animum attendite.

Apporto novam

Epidicazomenon quam vocant comoediam 25
Graeci, Latini Phormionem nominant3

Quia, primas partes qui aget, is erit Phormio

Parasitus, per quem res agetur maxime,

Voluntas vestra si ad poetam accesserit.

διο. Cicero also uses ‘ quum ’ in the sense
of ⁴ although.' See Pro Milone 35 ε “ Quin
hoc tempore ipso, quum omnes a meis ini-
micis faces meae invidiae subjiciantur, ta-
men omni in hominum coetu, gratiis agen-
dis et gratulationibus habendis, et omni
sermone, celebramur.’' Compare also Plau-
tus, Truculentus i. 2. 95, 96:

“Si illud quod volumus dicitur, palam
quum mentiuntur,

Verum esse insciti credimus: nae ut
aestu fluctuamur.''

24. Apporto] Compare Andria v. 2. l7,
ιιῃ(ἑ5ΪΪΜΕεῖιιιἰ1ιἰ;·ατονηιήοη] The Greek term
for an action brought in claim of a property

'or heiress adjudged to another was ἐπιδι-

* κασία (see Dictionary of Antiquities, ‘Ar-

chon,' p. 123, a). The plaintiff was said
ἐπιδικάζεσθαι. See Demosthenes, Contra
Macartatum1068: ὅτε δὲ τῆς ἐπικλήρου
ἔδει ἐπιδικάζεσθαι Φυλομάχης κ.τ.λ. and
an heiress who was the subject of such a
law-suit was called ἐπίδικος. Diodorus
Siculus (quoted by Perlet) mentions the
law of Solon in these terms: ἐκέλευε γὰρ
τῇ ἐπικλήρῳ ἐπιδικάζεσθαι τὸν ἔγγιστα
γένους (xii. 18). So this play is named
from the fact that Phormio, its principal
character, brings such an action. There
has been some controversy about the pro-

per title of this play. Donatus remarks

ἡ that the Phormio is a translation of the

‘ Epidicazomene ’ of Apollodorus, his ‘Epi-
dicazomenos ' being a different play. Bent-
ley inclines to this view, and proposes to
read ‘Epidicazomenen’ in the text. But
we are not justified in making the altera-
tion on the sole authority of Donatus ς nor
does Bentley’s remark “Ἐπιδικαζομένη est,
de qua judicium factum est'’ seem quite
accurate. An heiress in whose case judg-
ment had been given would be more pro—
perly called ἡ &marcovenam Itseems best
then to maintain the present text, according
to which the ἑπιδικαζόμενος is Phormio.
26. Latini Phormionem nominant]
Bentley, on the authority of one ancient

manuscript, reads ‘ Graece, Latine Phor-
mionem nominant,’ for two reasons: (l)
that this was a new play, “Dein Latini
ffissssqffinffffiff ,ἴρεῧὲἷὲ ⁰⁸„“0²¹„⁵ [ἓὲιξέἶ
rant.'' (2) That it was the custom for
poets to name their plays for themselves, as
Plautus often doeS, even when they had
other Greek names. The objection to
Bentley's reading is, Why should the name
‘ Phormio' (a Greek name derived from
φορμὸς) be called the Latin name of the
play? As to his arguments, Terence, nt
all events, has in every other ease re-
tained the Greek name of his plays. He
takes too literal a view of the words. Al-
though this play was now brought on the
Roman stage for the first time, we have no
reason for supposing that it was unknown
to Roman authors3 nor does it seem im-
probable that it was generally designaoed
by them as the ‘ Phormio,’ for the reason
which Terence gives here, namely, because
the character of Phormio is the most
conspicuous in the comedy. The Greek
words φορμὸς and φορμίον mean either a
basket, frequently used as a measure of
grain, or a mat; and it may not be impos-
sible that the name was given to a parasite
in allusion either to his capacity for food
(see Plautus, Menaechmei i. l. l, where
the name ‘Peniculus’ is similarly ex·
plained), or to the fact that these worthies
were often under the table at the supper
parties to which they invited themselves.

27. Primae parles qui ayet] The term
is bon-owed from the old Greek phraseology
of the drama, in which the acwrs were classed
as πρωταγωνιστὴς, δευτεραγωνιστής, or
C‘ibbssgziiiiazlvgraceszeuottlgd ihaiffiotgmdini
Eunuchus i. 2. 71. Hence the common
phrases, ‘primas ferre,’ ‘primas deferre:
‘primas dare,’ of which instances may be
found in all dictionariae. >

29. Voluntas vestra] ‘ Phormio,' he
says, ‘ will act the chief part, if your favour
comes to the help of the poet! Cicero
uses the word ‘voluntas' in the same
manner. See his oration for Rabirius,
