ἶ The story gains in circumstantiality in the hands of Nepos and Mem-

Ξ mius, and so far loses in probability. The more attentively the whole
’ξ , tale is considered, the less likely does it seem. A careful consideration
Ξ of Terence’s plays leads us to the conclusion that they are the produc-

ἓ,-

tion of a writer who was not only thoroughly educated, but had a con-

} sistent theory of dramatic composition, and ventured to alter and adapt

the existing materials of the Greek comedy‚ so as to bring them into
his system. Add to this the remarkable purity of the language of
Terence, which overleaps the whole interval between himself and Catul-
lus,—for in that interval we find nothing to compare with our author,—
and we cannot without a. violent inconsistency suppose that all this was
the result of the patchwork contributions of two or three dilettanti
noblemen‚ who used the name of their client as a screen in the indul-

* gence of their love of literary adventure. The whole story is simply

one of those pieces of literary gossip which gain credit from two causes3
partly because the contemporaries and nearer followers of such a writer
as Terence are apt to be jealous of the author who has no other certain
history than the paramount beauty and success of his works‚ and are
therefore glad to shift his praise to other shoulders ; and partly because,
when an author leaves no history but his works, there is a great tempta,
tion to make a history for his works, and to connect them with any
great names who may have happened to be his contemporaries. Laelius
and Scipio had as much claim to the authorship of these plays as Bacon

, has to that of the plays of Shakespeare3 and yet we have seen within

this year a serious attempt to father ‘ Shakespeare ' on the author of the
‘ Novum Organon.' Terence himself alludes to this charge more than

once 2

“ Tum quod malevolus vetus poeta dictitat,
Repente ad studium hunc se applicasse musicum,
Amicum ingenio fretum, haud natura sua;
Arbitrium vestrum, vestra existimatio
Valebit,''
(Heauton. Prolog. 22426)

and again:

“ Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli, homines nobiles
Eum adjutare, assidueque una scribere3
Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant
