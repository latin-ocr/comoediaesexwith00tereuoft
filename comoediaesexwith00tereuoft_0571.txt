TERENGE AND THE NEW OOMEDY. 497

sell my slave because she was good-looking; and has every thing now
her own way? See Meineke. Terence has a line in the Heautontimo-
ruuienos which has been compamd with this, and which Meineke has
taken for his guide in his restoration:

“.—- Ademtum tibi jam faxo omnem metum,v

In aurem utramvis otiose ut dormias.”
’ (ii. 3. 100, 101.)

We have, however, no reason for supposing that Terence had in view
the Πλόκιον as well as the Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος. As the expression ap·
pears in his play it is a general one, and may well have occurred in many
augggsi'ragment remains which we may refer to its probable place in
the play of Menander by a comparison with Terence:

Οἶκοι μένειν χρὴ καὶ μένειν ἐλεύθερον,
ἤ μηκέτ’ εἶναιΙ τὸν καλῶς εὐδαίμονα.
(Mein. Fragm. 'Eavr. vi.)
This is referred by Meineke to the dialogue between Menedemus and
Chremes, in which he supposes the latter thus to express his dis-

approbation of Clinia’s ssight from the country, and service in a foreign
army.

ADELPHI.
The ‘Adelphi' of Terence was in main taken from the Ἀδελφοι of

³ ψ Menander. One of its scenos, the rape of the music-girl from Sannio's

 

house, was, as Terence expressly tells us, taken word for word from the
zwaroowjaxoms of Diphilus:

‘⁸ Synapothnescontes Diphili comoedia est.
Eam Commorientes Plautus fecit fabulam.
In Graeca adolescens est qui lenoni eripuit
Meretricem in prima fabula. Eum Plautus locum
Reliquit integrum: eum hic locum sumpsit sibi
In Adelphos; verbum de verbo expressum extulit.”
(Prolog. vv. 6—11.)

Of tho Συναποθνῆσκονπς no recognized fragments remain. Its plot
may be conjectured with probability. See note on Prologue to Adelphi,
v. 8. Some of the fragments of the uncertain plays os Diphilus which
have been preserved sppear to have belonged to s scene much resem-
bling the opening scene of the ‘Adelphi’ of Terence. One or two
