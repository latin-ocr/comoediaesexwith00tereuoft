TERENCE' AND THE NEW coMEDY.

Tm Roman Comedy possesses so much in common with the N ew
Comedy of the Greeks, that, even were there no closer connexion
between the two, a consideration of the literary position of Terence
would be incomplet‘e without some notice of the Greek authors from
whom he copied. And this becomes essential, as a supplement to the
general consideration of Terence’s literary position which has been

’ = undertaken in the Introduction to this volume, when we find that all

of the existing plays of Terence were confessedly copied from Greek
originale. We have already seen that Terence was in general terms a
copyist. This objection was made against his plays, and answered
during his own lifetime. But I cannot but consider that this charge

A has been pressed too closely. It is the fashion to consider Terence’s

 

plays as simple translations in the closest sense. It will therefore be
interesting, and important for the due estimation of our author, to
examine in detail the imitatione of and allusione to Menander in his
plays, which can be now ascertained. With this view I shall place
before the reader those fragments of the several plays of Menander
which have apparently been imitated by Terence. After such a state-
ment of details we shall be prepared to go on to some more general
remarks upon the relation of Terence to his Greek originale.

Taking the plays in the order in which we find them in Terence, we

come first to the

ANDBLA.

This play was taken from the ‘Andria’ and the ‘ Perinthia' of

Menander. The most trustworthy account of these plays is that which
Terence himself gives us in the Prologue to the ‘ Andria‚’ vv. 9—14:

“ Menander fecit Andriam et Perinthiam.
Qui utramvis recte norit ambas noverit.
Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen
Dissimilioratione sunt factae ac stilo.
Quae convenere in Andriam ex Perinthia
Fatetur transtulisse atque usu'm pro suis.”
