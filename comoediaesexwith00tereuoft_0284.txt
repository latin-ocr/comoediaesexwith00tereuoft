So. Mi Chreme, peccavi, fateor: vincor : nunc hoc te obsecro,
Quanto tuus est animus natu gravior, ignoscentior,

Ut meae stultitiae in justitia tua sit aliquid praesidi.

Ch. Scilicet equidem istuc factum ignoscam: verum, Sostrata,

Male docet te mea facilitas multa.
Qua hoc occeptum est causa loquere.

31. Nunc hoc te obsecro] ‘ My dear
Chremes, Ι was wrong, I confess. 1 am
convinced. Now I beg you, that as your
mind is naturally more calm and more con-
siderate than mine, my folly may find some
protection in your justice.’ Unnecessary
difficulties have been raised about these
lines. ‘ Natu gravior’ may be an adapta-
'tion o‘f the common phrase ‘natu grandior ς’
but it seems more simple to take ⁴ natu ’ in
the 661166 of ‘natural ‘Ignoscentior’ means
‘ more ready to make allowances ς’ and gene-
rally, ( more considerate! See note on
‘ignoscere‚’ ii. l. 6. Bentley reeasts the
whole passage, professing not to understand
the common reading. Without any autho-
rity he would read ‘ Quanto tu me es annis
gravior tanto es ignoscentior3' but the in-
troduction of a definite sentence in the
place of the dependent clause, only serves
to weaken the connexion between· obsecro'
and· ut meae. .praesidi. '

40. Istuc reete,- conservasti te atque
illam] ‘Yon were very right to do that3

for you saved your conscience and preserved
her life) This is said ironically, from his
former point of view, namely, that this was
611 661 of disobedienoe. ⁴ You acted well,'
Chremes sayS, ‘in two ways. In the first
place you preferred your superstitious no-
tions to my command, and then you took
the best means to preserve the child whom
I wished to be destroyed! The ring nutu-
rully would lead any one who found 'the
child to think that it would be worth While
to bring it up, that its parents might ’601116
day be found and reward 111066 who had
preserved its life.

commentator-s compare the in Eu-
nuchus iv. 3. ll : ‘⁸ Eunuchum quem dedisti
nobis quas turbas deditl'’ But that ’16 a
case of inverse atti-action (666 note). In
the ‘passage before us we have only an m-
ticipation of the relative clause: 1116 aute·
