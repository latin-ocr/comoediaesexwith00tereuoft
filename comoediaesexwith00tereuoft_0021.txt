⁷ general, and iu speaking of his enemy 116 6661116 to assume that the

 

¹ hostility existing between them was already notorious. Again in the first
' Prologue to the ‘ Hecyra ’ (v. 8), the writer says:

“ Alias cognostis ejus: quaeso hanc nunc nos-ite?

ζ Now the ‘ Hecyra’ was brought forward for representation a second
Ξ 111116 111 ac. 165, 1116 year after the representation of the ‘Andria’

But, as Ι have remarked in the note on that passage, these words were
Ξ perhaps spoken at the last representation but one of the ‘Hecyrass'in
Ec. 160, in which case the speaker would have been able to allude to all
5<- the existing plays of Terence except the ‘Adelphis The case of the
>j ‘Andria’ is more difficu1t‚ for we cannot refer the Prologue to any re-

i Presentssfion Of the play after its first appearance. In this Prologue, as
well as in those of all the plays, with the exception of that belonging to

‘³5 the ‘Hecyra,’ the poet is evidently introducing his comedy for the first
s time to his audience. We cannot therefore account for the language of

this Prologue as 116 can for that of the Prologue to the ‘ Hecyra,' by

J supposing it to have been spoken on the occasion of a second or third

appearance of the play. We must then either suppose that other plays
existed of which we have no trace, perhaps youthful efforts, which fell
into obscurity after 15116 more mature productions of Terence had become

‘— popular3 or, to avoid such a gratuitous hypothesis, 116 must have re-

4 course to some explanation which shall derive probability from the
internal evidence of Terence's prologues. Such a piece of evidence pre-
„ sents itself to us in the Prologue to the ‘ Eunuchus.' Terence says,
3' speaking of Lavinius:
Δ Quam nunc acturi sumus
Menandri Eunuchum postquam Aediles emerunt,
Perfecit sibi ut inspiciendi esset copia.
Magistratus quum ibi adessent occepta est agi.
Exclamat furem non poetam fabulam
Dedisse, et nihil—dedisse verborum tamen.”

 

(vv. 19-24.)

It appears from this passage that Lavinius had obtained from the

¹ 1 Aediles permission 150 read over the ‘ Eunuchus ' before it was rehearsed
