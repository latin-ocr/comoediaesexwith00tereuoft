Aer 111. Serene V. Chaerea comes out
of Thais’ house in a state of ecstasy now
that his design upon Pamphila has com·
pletely succeeded. At the same time he
is afraid of meeting any one in his pre-
sent eostume. At this moment Antipho
accosts him, and soon leads him to give
a full account of his adventures in Thais’
house: how he had substituted himself
for Dorus: how he had acted his part
to per-fection before Thais, and had been
put in charge of the very girl whom he
had fallen in love with in the street:
how an unex opportunity had offered
of carrying out his designs, and he had taken
advantage of it. He goes off with Antipho
ιο get rid of his clothes, and meet his friends
at sup r.

l. Nemo homo eet] ‘ Nemo ' is used with
⁰ homo ' more than once in Terence. Com-
pare Adelphi ii. 3. 6: “ Fratrem homini
nemini esse primarum artium magis princi-
pem.” Phemio iv. 2. 1:

⁴⁴ Ego hominem callidiorem vidi neminem
Quam Phormionem.’'

The phrase occurs also in Plautus, Persa ii.
2. 292 ‘⁸ Nemo homo unquam ita arbi-
tratus eet.'' Cicero uses it once or twice.
2 Iamne erumpere hoe licet mihi qau-
ditm ?] ⁴ Can ῐ now give vent ιο my present

joy ?’ Thia ia one os a few passages in

which ‘erumpo' is used transitively. So
Cicero says ‘⁸ Hunc (librum) tu tralatum in
macrocolum lege arcano convivis tuis3 sed,
si me amas, hilaris et bene acceptis, ne in
me stomachum erumpant quum tibi sint
iratist Ad Atticum xvi. 3. 2. Livy xxxvi. 7 ι
“ Cujus si talis animus est, solvamus nos ejus
vincula et *claustra refringamus, ut erumpere
diu coercitam iram in hostes communes
possit.'' Tibullus iv. l. 88: “Fontibus ut
dulces erumpat terra liquores.'’

4. Contaminee] ‘That life may not mar
my present joy by any sorrrow.' For ⁸ con-
taminet ' see note on Andria, Prol. 16. For
the sentiment compare Andria v. 5. 2 and
note.

5. Sed neminemne] ⁸ But why does not
some curious fellow fall in with me, to follow
me wherever Ι ge. and bore me with ques-
tions ?’ Very naturally Chaerea is made to
express a sort of desire for the very com-
pany which he would have been most likely
to avoid. He is fun of an important secret,
and must have it out ιο some one or an-
other. The negative form of the sentence
31:53 bssssffidgmi'hssoffffri iffmsszzs'zffl
the following passage shows. Mr. Winkle
is about to fight with Dr. Slammer, and
has made several ineffectual attempta to
induce his friend Mr. Snodgrass to inter-
fere.

panion's devoted friendship·internally‚ as
