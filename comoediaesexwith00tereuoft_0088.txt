Putabam, et magnum exemplum continentiae.

AN DRIA.

Nam qui cum ingeniis conflictatur ejusmodi,
Neque commovetur animus in ea re tamen,
Scias posse habere jam ipsum suae vitae modum.
Cum id mihi placebat tum uno ore omnes omnia

Bona dicere, et laudare fortunas meas

Qui gnatum haberem tali ingenio praeditum.

Quid verbis opus est Ρ hac fama impulsus Chremes,
Ultro ad me venit unicam gnatam suam

Cum dote summa filio uxorem ut daret.

Placuit ; despondi. Hic nuptiis dictus est dies.

So. Quid obstat cur non verae fiant P Si. Audies.
Fere in diebus paucis quibus haec acta sunt

Chrysis vicina haec moritur.

Beasti; metui a Chryside.

Curabat una funus, tristis interim,

Nonnunquam collacrumabat:

Sic cogitabam; Hic, parvae consuetudinis
Causa, mortem hujus tam fert familiariter:

παρατρίβομαι ὥστε μολύβδῳ χρυσός.
Translate: ⁴ For when a man comes into col-
lision with such characters as these, and yet
his heart is not moved thereby, you may feel
sure that he is then well able to rule his
own life! Τὴε word ‘conflictatur' may
suggest a reference to the test in which
metals were rubbed together for the pur-
pose of trying their purity. ΤΙιιιε Aesch.
Ag. 390: τρίβῳ τε καὶ προσβολαῖς με-
λαμπαγὴς πέλει δικαιωθείς. Compare also
Herod. vii. 10.

73. Ultro ad me venit] Τὴε distinction
between ⁴ ultro ’ and ⁴ sponte ’ seems to be
really as follows. The native signification
of ‘ultro' is ‘in that direction,' ‘sm-ther, '
‘beyond,’ originally in phrases expressin'g
⁴motion to! Hence it means ‘moreoverss
and, as here, ‘ of oneself,’ ⁴ over and above
what was expected! So Chremes came ‘ with-
out being asked.' Compare Eun. i. 1. 2:
‘⁴ Quum arcessor ultro‚'’ ⁴ without my beg-
ging for an interview! ⁴ Sponte,’ on the
other hand, must be connected with the
root ‘spons‚' which appears in ‘ spondeo!
A man acts ‘sponte ’ when he acts of his
own accord, without any compulsion; ⁴ ul-
tro,' when he does more than is expected of

ἐς βάσανον δ’ ἐλθὼν

him, when he goes beyond our hopes
beyond what is required by the antecedente
of the case. Thus ⁴ ultro bellum inferre,’
‘ to commence war without provocation!
Compare the passage above quoted in Eun.
i. 1. 2, and note on Eun. i. 1. 25.

80. Una aderat srequem] 4 He was
continually there with those who were
lovers of Chrysis!

82. Nonnunquam collacrumabat] Stall-
baum considers that ‘collacrumo’ is here
put for the simple ‘ lacrumo! sse force of
this preposition is often partially lost in com-
pound verbs, as in ‘commereor‚’ ‘ oomprecor,'
4 concurso,’ 4 commeo,¹ and many others,
though there is in all perhaps the general
sense of completeness or abundance. Here,
however, the word may mean, ‘he would
sometimes weep together with them!

ley was the first to transpose the text thus.
The ordinary reading is ‘quid hic mihi!
It is clear that both for metre and sense
Bentley's emendation is desirable. Trans-
position is so likely to have injured the
text of Terence in the hands of copyists
that we may the more readily have recourse
to it as a remedy in cases of difficulty. With
the sentiment, which is a happy touch of
