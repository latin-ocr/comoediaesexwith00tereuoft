27. Aliquid . . . quo] It would have
been unsuitable to have mentioned 8 sword,
which is implied in the words, ‘ How I wish
Ι had something or other here to throw
myself upon.' “Non dixit gladium aut
laqueum, ne esset tragicum,” says Do-
natus. Stallbaum supposes him to mean
a deep ditch, quarry, or the like to throw
himself into. Either will do. If it were
not that bad translations are apt to mis-
lead students, I would not notice Hickie’s
blunder, ‘Would to heaven there were
some precipice whence now to throw my-
self and break my neck.y ¹ Quo ' is, as all
the world knows, the accusative case of
motion towards, equivalent to ‘in quem
locum,’ and so here it is used for ‘in
quod! Sometimes it is used where the
plural of the pronoun would be required,
as in Plautus, Asinaria ii. 2. 48:

“ Tantum facinus modo inveni eg0, ut nos
dicamur duo
Omnium dignissimi esse quo cruciatus
confluant.''

See note on Eunuchus iii. l. 60.

Acr III. Sca-NE V. Pamphilus having
> been informed by his father of Chremes'
consent to his marriage with Philumena,
now comes in search of Davus, determined
to wreak his vengeance upon h'im. Davus
mitigates him by promising to find some
escape from his present perplexities.

Metre3 vv. 1- 14, iambic tetrameter3
15-18, trochaic tetrameter catalectic.

1.] Bentley would read, “Ubi illic est?
Scelus qui me hodie- Perii: atque 1100
confiteor jure. ’' He considers ‘perdidit’
an interpolation. The change is unneces-
sary, and his omission of‘ mihi’ entirely
unwarranted. The scansion of the line is
rather difficule. We must remember that
‘ubi’ is pronounced 80 the French‘ ou,’
and consequently elided; and that ‘illic’

and ‘ scelus ' are pronounced 80 monosyl-
lables. See the Introduction. The union
of ‘ scelus qui ’ is parallel to that of ‘senium
qui,' Eun. ii. 3. 10; as παιδίον ὅστις. So
in Anacreon iii. 17, βρέφος φέροντα τόξον.

2. Iners] ‘ Since Ι 8111 00 dull, and 00
shiftless.’ The word is here used in its
strict etymological sense.

3. F‘utili] Literally ‘leaky,' ‘that will
not hold.y Compare “ Futilis glacies‚'' Vir-
gil, Aen. xii. 740, ‘brittle.’ There was a
vessel used in the rites of Vesta called ‘ vas
futile‚’ which was too nari-ow at the bottom
to stand upright, and spilt the water if set
down. So persons who could not keep a
secret were called ‘futiles' Compare the
speech of Parmeno, in Eunuchus i. 2. 23—

“ Quae vera audivi taceo et contineo op-

Sidlrpaelsium aut vanum aut fictum est,
continuo ‘palam est3

ΡΙΞῐίιιξη rimarum sum; hac atque 1118ορ01·-

In a converse sense we have the phrase
στέγειν 111 Greek, to‘ keep secret!

τί χρὴ, τί χρὴ με, ‹iecorum-U, εν ξένῃ ξένον
στὲγειν; ὴ τι λεγειν πρὸς ἄνδρ’ ὑπόπταν;

Sophocles, Philoct. 136.

And so Plato,' m a remarkable passage de-
scribing those who pursue the pleasures of
sense as living the lives of beasts ofthe field,
says, οὐδὲ τοῦ ὄντος τῷ ὄντι επληρώ-
θησαν, οὐδὲ βεβαίου τε και καθαρᾶς
ἡδονῆς ἑγευσαι το, ἀλλὰ βοσκημάτων δι’·
κηι κάτω ἀεὶ βλέποντες, καὶ κεκυφότες εἷς,-
γῆ] καὶ εἰς τραπέζας, βόσκονται χορτα-
ζό’μειοι καὶ ὀχεύοντες.. ἅτε οὐχὶ τοῖς
οὖσιν οὐδὲ τὸ ὂν οὐδὲ τὸ στέγον ἑαυτῶν
πιμπλάντες, ‘their souls are not continent
and cannot be filled with thes se pleasuresss
(Republic, p. 586.)
