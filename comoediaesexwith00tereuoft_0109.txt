Tibi non det gnatam. N ec tu ea causa minueris
Haec quae facis ne is mutet suam sententiam.

Patri dic velle, ut cum velit tibi jure irasci non queat.
N am quod tu speres propulsabo facile.

Uxorem his moribus

Dabit nemo ; inveniet inopem potius quam te corrumpi sinat.
Sed si te aequo animo ferre accipiet, negligentem feceris :
Aliam otiosus quaeret : interea aliquid acciderit boni.

18-24.] Tbese lines have occasioned
stu-ange misapprehensions. Nothing is neces-
sary but to keep clearly in mind the two
points which Davus desires to impress on
Pamphilus, that Chremes will never give him
his daughter3 and that a ready consent will
disarm his father’s anger and put him off
his guard. ‘It is quite clear,’ says Da-
vus, ⁴ that Chremes will never give you his
daughter. But do not yon alter your present
conduct for any sear that he may change
his mind. Tell your father that you are
ready ιο marryg that, however much he
may wish it, he may not bo able fairly to be
angry with you. For 1 will easily set aside
what you may perhaps hope: No one will
marry his daughter to a man of my cha-
mter. For your father will rather look out
sor a poor wife than allow you to go to the
dogs. But if he finds that you take it
quietly. you will have put him off his guard:
he will look out for another bride at his
letne: meanwhile things may take a lucky
turn! The connexion of the clauses is
ather abrupt3 but the meaning is plain:
Pamphilus might oppone his father's wishes
οι two munds: (l) because he was afraid
that his consent would lead to his marriage
with Philumena: (2) he might think that
no hle man would have him for a
son-in-law, and that therefore it would be
-fe to carry on his love affair openly.
Davus shows him the fallacy of both sup-

...j‘ ·
ἱ, pedasus.

18. muner-in] ⁶ Minue ¹ means ‘to leave

out: montera so in amyra iv. 3. ιο.
ζῇ “Sed non minuam meum consilium.”
Compare Lucretius ii. 1026:

ἲ. “ Nil adeo mag-num, nec tam mirabile qnid-

priri'sigio qu⁶d non minuant mirarier

omnes
Paullatim.’'
sl. Hs· moribus] Some understand this

strangely enough of Glycerium; but there
was no question of giving her in marriage
ιο Pamphilus. We find the same phrase in
Propertius iv. ll. 16: “Moribus his alia
conjuge dignus eras ;” Quintilian v. 12:
“ Nunquam tamen hoc contingit malis mo-
ribus regnum.” In Hecyra iv. 4. 22 we
have a fuller phrase, ⁴‘ Quid mulieris Ux-
orem habes aut quibus moratam moribus? '’

22. Te corrumpi] ⁴ Rather than allow
you ιο be ruined.’ Simo would put up
with a poor connection rather than that
his son should continue ιο keep a mistress,
‘corrumpi’ is frequently used of young
men. See Adelphi i. 217: “Tu illum
corrumpi sinis.''

25. Quin taces?] ‘ Quin ' interrogative is
never used but in the sense of an earnest
command. ⁴ Be silent. can't you? ' This
use is very common in Terence. “ Quin
dicis unde est clare?’' iv. 4. 15, ¹ tell me
out lond, won’t you, where it comes
from Ρ Compare Heaut. iv. 7. 4: ‘⁴ Quin
accipis?” ‘take it, can't you?' In this
sense we always find the indicative moed.
With the imperative mood ‘quin' has an
expostulatory force, as in ii. 2. 9: “Quin
tu hoc audi‚'' ⁸ nay but do you hear me ς’
ii. 6. 18: “Quin dic quid est?¹' ⁴ nay but
tell me; what is it ?’ Compare i. 1. 18,
and Phormio ii. 3. 15.

26. Cautio est] The verbalused for the
gerundive‚ in imitation of the Greek, ὀρατέα,
common in Plautus, Bacchid. iv. 1. 25:

‘⁴ Quum-ego hujus verba interpretor, mihi
Nec‘iiiitdilrtiizigibula excussit c malis meis.”

Compare also Poenulus i. 3. 36. and Pseu.
dolus i. 2. 38. See Adelphi iii. 3. 672
‘⁶ Pisces ex sententia Nactus sum ε hi mihi
ne corrumpantur cautio est.’' Besides this
neuter use of the verbal substantive, we
find also another imitation of the Greek
