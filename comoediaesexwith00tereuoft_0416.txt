HEOYRA.

Ph. Non aedepol mirum. Pa. Atqui ea res multo maxime 85
Disjunxit illum ab illa, postquam et ipse se,

Et illam, et hanc quae domi erat, cognovit satis,

Ad exemplum ambarum mores earum existimans.

Haec, ita uti liberali esse ingenio decet,

Pudens, modesta; incommoda atque injurias

Viri omnes ferre, et tegere contumelias.
Hic animus partim uxoris misericordia
Devinctus‚ partim victus hujus injuriis,

Amorem, postquam par ingenium nactus est.

Interea in Imbro moritur cognatus senex
Horunce : ea ad hos redibat lege hereditas.

Eo amantem invitum Pamphilum extrudit pater.
Relinquit cum matre hic uxorem3 nam senex

Rus abdidit se ; huc raro in urbem commeat.

Ph. Quid adhuc habent infirmitatis nuptiae P

Pa. Nunc audies.

Bene conveniebat sane inter eas.

88. Ad exemplum ambarum] ‘This‚’
says Parmeno, ‘was by far the most im-
portant thing that estranged him from her3
when became to himself, and was well ac-
quainted both with her, and with his wife
at home, and formed his opinion of their
characters by the specimen which they both
gave of them.’ ‘ Exemplum ’ signifies pro-
perly 1 6 sample‚' something taken from 6
large quantity. Its derivation is uncer-
tain3 but that from ‘eximo' seems most
natural, though some take it as from ¹ ex
amplo! cicero gives a good instance of its
literal use. “Si acervos se dicant tritici
habere. et eorum exemplum pugno non ha-
beantstf Auct. ad Herennium iv. 6. In
this sense it is used here. The ordinary
use of the word requires no explanation.

· For other phrases in Terence see notes

on Eunuchus v. 4. 23, and Adelphi i. 2.

97. Εα αᾱ hos redibat leye hereditas]
See note on Andria iv. 5. 4. In the follow-
ing line ‘extrudit ’ is used to show that
Laches had some difficulty in persuading
Pamphilus to leave his wife, now that he
was hemming attached ‘to‘ her. However,

Pamphilus went, and left his wife with his
mother, Sostrata. His father knew no-
thing of the state of affairs between his wife
and her daughter-indam for he shut him-
self up in his farm, and seldom came to
town. The phrase ‘rus abdidit se' in v.
100 may be compared with Cicero, Ad Fam.
xiii. 29: 11 Itaque abdidit se in intimam
Macedoniam.” Κρὺπτομαι is used in the
same way, as in a fable of Babrius, v. ³1 τ
ἐκρύπτετ’ οἴκου γωνίην, ‘he went into n.
corner of the house to hide himself.’ For
1 commeo ' see note on its frequentative
‘ commeto ’ Heaut. i1i. 1. 35.

105. Postulatio nunquam] ‘ Somou
and her daughter-in-law did not come to an
open quarrel, nor was there ever any dis-
pute between them.' We find ‘ postulatio ³
in this sense in Plautus, Bacchides iii. 3.
45 : ‘⁴ Acris postulatio haec est, quum hu-
jus dictaintelligo.’' See also Casina iii. 2.
26. From the connexion of ‘lites' and
‘ postulatio ’ in this line we may conclude
that the latter word was purposely intro-
duced with reference to its forensic use.
1 Postulatio ' was a word used in* religione
rites 1n the sense of‘ an expiatory sacrifice:
and in law it is used 111 1116 sense of‘ am
application for leave to bring an action.’
