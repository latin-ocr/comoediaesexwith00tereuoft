498 TERENOE AN D THE N EW OOMEDY.

examples will be sufficient to prove a general resemblance, which is all

that is contended for, and which, without any additional testimony, yill

not warrant us in referring these fragments to ΐὼεΣυναποθνήσκοντες.
Thus in Diphili Fab. Incert. Fragm. xv. we have:

’Όστις γὰρ αὐτὸς αὑτὸν οὔκ αἰσχύνεται
συνειὸόθ’ αὑτῷ φαῦλα διαπεπραγμένῳ
πῶς τόν γε μηδὲν εἰδότ’ αἶσχυνθήσεταις

which reminds us in some degree of the following lines of Terence:

“Nam ‘qui mentiri aut fallere insuerit patrem, aut
Audebit, tanto magis audebit caeteros.”

(Adelph. i. 1. 30, 31.)
Ι Again, Fragm. xxi:

Ἀνὸρὸς φίλου καὶ συγγενοῦς καὶ οἰκίαν
αὑτοῦ νομίζειν δεῖ τὸν ὀρθῶς συγγενῆ.

Compare Adelphi v. 3. 17, 18:

“ --— Vetus verbum hoc quidem est
Communia esse amicorum inter se omnia‚”

on which a common Greek proverb, κοινὰ τὰ τῶν φίλων, is quoted from
Menander. See note.

The following fragment (Diph. Fab. Incert. xvii.) z

ιὋς δ’ οὔτ’ ἐρυθριᾶν οἶδεν οὔτε δεδιέναι,
τὰ πρῶτ’ ἁπάσης τῆς ἀναιδείας ἔχει,

is given again as Fragm. clxxiii. of the uncertain plays of Menander3
which is to some extent a proof that there was a play of Diphilus
resembling one of Menander’s. And we 'are perhaps, from Terence’s
account of his play noticed above, justified in concluding that these two
similar plays were the Ἀδελφοι and the Συναποθνήσκοντες.

Passing to the ascertained fragments of the *Αδελφοι of Menander, we
find some plain parallels to passages in Terence’s play, which are placed
here in the order of the Latin Comedy.

Adclphi i. 1. 18:

“ —- Quod fortunatum isti putant,
Uxorem nunquam habui.”

Menander, Fragm *Αὸελφ. i.:
Ὠ μακάριόν μ’ [ὅστις] γυναῖκ’ οὗ λαμβάνω,

according to Meineke's restoration. In my note on the passage of
Terence I have read, ὦ μακάριόν με. οὗ γυναῖκα λαμβάνω.
