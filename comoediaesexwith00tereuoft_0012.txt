vi PREFAOE.

In determining the text of Terence we have almost as much
difficulty as in any classica] author. To pass from modern editions,
in which the student is puzzled to decide which is the ori-
ginal reading, and which the conjecture (for most modern editors
have more or less consistently followed Bentley's emendations);

even when we come to the comparatively pure and ancient

text we are not yet on. certain ground. The difficulty of Terence' s ’

text is that it is too perfect. His plays have been so popular, and
so much in use as a text book, that it is impossible not to suspect
that in many cases, which we cannot now hope to discover, the
smooth corrections of schoolmasters and professors have superseded
the native reading of the author. So Ritschl says, “ Omnino vix
ullam scenam esse fabularum Terentianarum puto in qua non ali-
quid turbatum sit gravius, criticae artis medicinam etiam post
Bentleii curas expectans ¹.'' And the same uncertainty extends
even to the oldest manuscript with which we are acquainted. A
careful examination of the whole text of Terence has convinced me
of the truth of another remark of Ritschl : “ Nam in Terentio tam
aperta plurimis locis est quam in Plauto rara fuit correctricis
manus opera in refingendis resarciendisque versibus consumpta, ,
eaque ex antiquiore aetate repetenda quam qua ipse Bembinus liber
scriptus est: longius autem a Terentiana integritate Bembinus
quam a Plautina Ambrosianus abest ².'' I will here briefly men-
tion the materials which the Editor has at hand for the purpose of
fixing the text of Terence.

sse most important Manuscript is that which goes by the name of
the “ Bmcinmssss' from its possessor, Pietro Bembo. It was corrected-
and illustrated by Politian. It finally passed into the hands of
Fulvius Ursini, and by him was bequeathed to the Vatican Library.
This Manuscript, with many others of good stamp,„was used by Faern
in his edition of Terence, completed after his death by Victor (As).
