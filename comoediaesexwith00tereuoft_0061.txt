rule the preceding examples embraoe all the usual cases of the accentua-
tion of dissyllabic words on the last syllable. A few others are found
in similar positione, and of 'these -many are contracted verbs, as redit,
abit, Sne„ where t-he contraction affects the quantity of the syllable as
much as the position.

β. Last syllables of ‘polysyllabic words lengthened by ‘ ictus :'

‘⁶ Μαῖεῶίοενέ, malefacta ne noscaeint sua.”
(And. Prol. 23.)

“ Potin es mihi verum dicer? ‚7 Nihil faciliusR’
(And. ii. 6. 6.)

“ Poetae ad scribendum adyedt indiistriam.’'
(Adelph. Prol. 25.)

1 do not mention here the numerous cases of words occurring at the
end of a line where themetre necessarily requires a long syllable. On
the other hand we have one instance at least in Terence of the
shortening of a final syllable, in spite of its position, occurring in the
thesis of the last foot:

“ Video: horsum pergunt. Quid dicam hisce ince‘rtus sum.’'
(Hec. iii. 4. 36.)

γ. Penultimate syllables of polysyllabic words shortened in pronun-

ciation, the accent being thrown back.
A great many instances of this practice are given by Lindemann

from Plautus. See his introduction ‘De Prosodia Plauti? p. xiv, xv.
The following passages may be quoted from Terence:

“ Si quando illa dicet, Phaedriam

Comissatum intromittamus .· tu Pamphilam.''
(Eun. iii. 1. 51, 52.)

“ Si id est peccatum pe'coatum imprudentia est.‘'
(Eun. Prol. 27.)

“ Homo de improvis03 coepit oldsmame, O Aeschine.'’
(Adelph. iii. 3. 53.)

“ Metui ne haereret hic. Atque iratwm admodum.·”
(Adelph. iii. 3. 49.)

‘⁴ Penfiria est: homo antiqua virtute fio fide.”
(Ade1ph. iii. 3. 88.)
