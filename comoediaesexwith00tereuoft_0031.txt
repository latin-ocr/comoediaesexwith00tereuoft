“ eyry of children, little eyases‚ that cry out on the top of question, and
are most tyrannically clapped for’t,'’ to the stage of Shakespeare.

The characters which appear in the plays of Terence are in the main
borrowed from the ordinary repertory of the New Comedy. These
characters are well described in Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Art
and Literature (Lect. xiv.); but without any particular reference to
their treatment by Terence. In the Classical Museum, vol, vii., there
is 8 good article on Ritschl’s Plautus, containing among other useful
matter ‘an interesting general parallel between Plautus and Terence;

- and a discussion of the characters of their plays—in which, however,

there is little novelty. ·It is true that, generally speaking, the characters

ᾗ· of the New Comedy passed on to Plautus and Terence, just as from

them they descended to Ariosto‚ (who endeavoured in his versi sdruccioli
to imitate the iambic trimeter,) Aretino‚ and Metastasio; but if w'e
examine them carefully we shall find the widest difference of treatment.
I have 111 the notes on these plays taken many occasions of remarking
upon the originality of some of Terence’s characters. I may refer the
reader to the treatment of the characters of the braggadocio and the
parasite in the ‘Eunuchus‚' of Phormio, of Parmeno in the ‘Hecyra‚'

as compared with the slaves in the other plays. Indeed every slave that -

appears in Terence has 1118 distinctive marks. Davus, in the ‘Andria,‘
is impudent and crafty, never at a loss in any perplexity, and comes off
finally triumphant. Syrus in the ‘ Heautontimorumenos ’ resembles
him in general character, only that he is even more crafty, and carries
out his plots with greater skill and impunity. His namesake in the
‘Adelphi’ is perhaps one of the most amusing specimens of his tribe
in Terence's plays. His unblushing effrontery in lying on every neces-
sary occasion, and the impudence with which he satirizes Demea to his
face, give him a distinct character. The Parmeno of johe ‘ Eunuchus ’ is
8 plotter by nature, but not by intention. He is alarmed when Phaedria

’ adopts and acts upon his schemen and his timidity becomes simple

despair when at the end of the play Pythias retaliates on him with a
dreadful story of the punishment of his young master. His namesake
in the ‘ Hecyra' is simply a sententious busybody‚ of 110 use whatever

7 in the action of the play, and introduced merely for the sake of the in·

formation which 110 0811 communicate respecting his master. Geta, in
the ‘Phormio,' is also a subordinate character3 and his only merit is
that he is zealous for his pupils, and utterly regardless of his duty to his

’ 0111 master. The part usually played by the slave, of deceiving the
