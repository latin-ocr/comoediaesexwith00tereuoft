In conformity with this general principle we have the following rules:

α. All dissyllables were paroxytone ; as ‘deus‚’ ‘regnum,’ ‘zimas‚’ ‘pugna’

β. Hyperdissyllabic words with long penultima were paroxytone3 as
‘ ameibunt,’ ‘ regnabisss ‘sororem‚’ ‘ argentum) Α

γ. Hyperdissyllabic words with short penultima were proparoxyton03
as ‘ pectoris ’ ‘ consili,’ ‘ delfidierss ‘ aureus)

All these rules are subject to certain modifications in consequence of
the position of words in metrical lines, which I will now briefly consider
with reference to Terence.

a. Dissyllables. These are of necessity constantly placed in iambic
metre as forming a foot, where, consequently‚ the accent falls on
the last syllable. I take the following instanees of the possible -

position of such words in iambic verse chiefly from the opening scene of
the Andria ι

1. “ Sed iis quas semper in te intellexi sitas.”
2. “ Ego postquam te emi a pzirvulo ut sempe'r ‘cibis’
3. “ In Pamphilo ut nihil sit morae, restat Chremes.’'

This last case is eomparatively rare, and occurs chiefly when the fifth
foot is a spondae. Two iambic words very rarely end a line.

4. “Nosse omnia haee saltis est adolescentulis?
(Eun. v. 4. 18.)

“ Persuasit nox, amo'r, vinum, adolescentia?
(Adelph. iii. 4. 24 ³.)

5. “Sed postquam amans accessit, pretium p6llicens.’'

6. “ Nunqua'sm praeponens se illis: ita facillime.”

These examples show some of the cases in which a dissyllable may stand
alone as an iambic word, i. e. with the last syllable accented. The
reader who desires to analyse minutely the verbal structure of the
various forms of comio verse, may be referred to Bitschl’s discussion of
this subject in his Prolegomena to Plautus. I pass on now to some
other cases in which the accent of words deserves notice. As a general

³ Bentley reads ‘⁴ Scelesta ovem lup6 commisi '’ in Eun. v. 1. 163 but against the
authority of the manuscripts. See note. It is very rare to find an instance of the accented
last syllable in the second metre of the iambic trimeter. These are the only certain pas·
seges in Terence3 and it is evident‚ as Bentley remarks, that here the position of tho word
is justified more by the sense than by any other consideration.
