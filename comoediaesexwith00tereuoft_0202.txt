PYTHIAS.

PHAEDRIA.

DORIAS.

Py. Ubi ego illum scelerosum misera atque impium inveniam?

aut ubi quaeram?

4. Dum haec puto] ‘ While Ι 0111 think-
ing over this) ‘ Puto ' is sometimes used
in the sense of ‘ reputo.' Compare Adelphi
v. 3. 8: ⁴⁴ Rem ipsam putemus.’' virgil,
Aen. vi. 332:

“ Constitit Anchisa satus, et vestigia
pressit,
Multa putans, sortemque animo mise-
ratus iniquam.’'

6. Male vero me habens] See note on
Andria ii. 3. 4.

7. Ubi ad ipsum veni diverticulum]
‘ When Ι came to the very turning to my
house Ι stood still) The right reading is
⁸ diverticulum,’ which is confounded with
‘ deverticulum' in Forcellini, and in most
’ texts of the classical authors. ‘ Deverticu-
lum' like ‘deversorium ' would mean an
‘inn’ or ‘a house by the wayside,' κατ-
αγωγεῖον. ‘Diverticulum’ would strictly
mean ‘ the branching off of two roads.' But
it is very possible that this distinction was
not observed even by the Romans them-
selves, as the two senses have a natural ten-
dency to run into one another.

12. Certe eoetrema linea Amare haud
nihil est] ¹ At all events it is something to
make love even at a respectful distance!
Commentators have given numerous expla-
nations of the words ‘ extrema linea‚'
which occur only in this passage. The

most feasible is that of Zeune, who says
“ Forte ad popularem rationem propius ac-
cedunt, qui de linea alba in Circo, seu ealce,
originem ducunt.’' The ‘linea' was the
barrier which stretched across the race-
course, which the racers could not pass till
the signal was given. The ⁴ extrema linea,’
therefore, in this passage, is the barrier at
the end of the course, beyond which the
lover is not allowed for the present to go.
A similar expression occurs in Propertius i.
12. (ll.) 6: “Ecquis in extremo restat
amore locus ?'' ‘ is there any room left for
me at the very extremity of your love ?’
‘ Can you spare me a mere corner ?’

Aer IV. Scmm ΙΙΙ. While Phaedria 15
speculating on returning to the company of
Thais, Pythias suddenly rushes on the ’
stage, followed by Dorias, hoping to catch
the eunuch who has thrown their house-
hold into disturbance and has now made
his escape. She tells her story to Phaedria,
who naturally concludes that she is intoxi-
cated or mad. He determines to clear up
the matter at once, and goes to his own
house to see if Dorus is there.
