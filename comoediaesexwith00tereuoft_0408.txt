commended his art to my keeping, and him-
self to your good saith, his enemies may not
glory over his discomflture without cause.’
‘ Circumveniri ’ is common in Cicero in the
sense of the text. See In C. Verrem ii. 4. 8:
“ Quid te a Centuripina civitate, a Catinensi,
ab Halesina, . . .circumveniri atque opprimi
dicis? tua te Messana circumvenit‚'' and
Tuscul. Disput. i. 41, in his translation of
Socrates' speech from Plato’s Apology:
⁴⁴ Quanta delectatione autem afficerer, quum
Palamedem, quum Ajacem, quum alios,
judicio iniquo circumventos, convenirem ?'’

49. Posthac pretio emtas meo] These
words have occasioned a good deal of con-
troversy. We know from other passages
that plays were purchased by the aediles
in the first instance for the purpose of re-
presentation at the games. (See Eunuchus,
Prolog. v. 20). Donatus accordingly ex-
plains ‘ pretio meo ¹ by ⁴ aestimatione a me
facta quantum aediles darent‚’ that the
aediles consulted Ambivius, as an expe-
rienced stage-managa, as to the proper
⁴ price to be set on a play. This, however,
is not supported by any authority3 and
would not have been (as Colman remarks)
a very creditable mode of settling the assize
of plays. The probability is that the stage-
managers sometimes purchased plays on
their own account3 and this may have hap-
pened in the case of plays which had failed
from some accident, as‘ in the case of the
Hecyra, but which the managei· knew to
have sufficient merit to entitle them to suc-
cess. That plays were sold more than once

we know from the first Prologus, vf7. But p

this whole subject is so obscure, that we
cannot do more than hazard a probable

conjecture.

Ac'r Ι. Scarus Ι. This scene is quite
superfluous as far as the action of the play
is concerned. The following scene gives us
the real Introduction or Prologus to the
play, in which the conduct of Pamphilus is
related up to the point at which the action
commences. Here we have two characters,
Syra and Philotis, who are not in any way
concerned with the action. They talk over
the fact of Pamphilus’ marriage, which Phi-
lotis considers to be a breach of his engage-
ment to his mistress, Bacchis; for he had
promised her that he would never marry
during her lifetime. Syra, the old woman,
takes occasion from this to advise Philotis
never to show men any mercy; buttofleeoe
and spoil them to the utmost.

The Metre is iambic trimeter. ,

1. Per pol quam paucos] For ‘ perquam
paucos! See note on Andria iii. 2. 6.
Bentley considers ‘ paucis ’ to be the right
reading, and to be supported by the lines
which Donatus quotes from Apollodorus.
These have been restored by Bentley thus:

ghssyatc ἐραστὴς γέγον’ ἐταίραισι, Σῦρά,
ε αιος.

But this is at the best a happy conjecture,
and is not sufficient to fix our text. On tha
contrary, I think that ¹ paucos' is required
by the following lines; for Terence goes on
to dwell on the conduct of Pamphilus, who
might have been supposed an exception to
the rule of infidelity in lovers. ΤΙιθ con-
nexion of ideas is: ‘ How few lovers do we
Even this Pamphilus has
If ‘ paucis ' had been
used, then Bacchis' name would have been

made more prominent.
