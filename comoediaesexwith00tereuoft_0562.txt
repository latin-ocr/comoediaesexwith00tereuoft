488 TERENOE AN D THE N EW OOMEDY.

In default of further information we may observe that from the words
of Terence it appears (1) that these two plays of Menander were in
plot much alike, but different in Ianguage and style3 and (2) that he
borrowed certain suitable pieces from the' ‘ Perinthia‚’ and inserted·
them in his translation of the ‘ Andria.' The plots of Menander were
very simple, and Terence was probably obliged, in order to suit the
taste of his Roman audience, to eke out the ‘Andria’ by supplying
some incident from the ‘ Perinthia.' Unfortunately materials are not
left to enable us to adjudge the comparative obligations of Terence to
these two plays. The following are the only passages of Terence to
which the ingenuity of critics have as yet been able to find parallels in
Menander :—

Acr I. Somni 1. Of this scene Donatus says, on Prolog. v. 10:
“ Prima scena Perinthiae paene iisdem verbis quibus Andria scripta est;
caetera dissimilia sunt, exceptis duobus locis, altero ad versus xi, altero
ad versus xx, qui in utraque fabula positi sunt ;'' and on v. 13 he asks: ‚
“Quare se onerat Terentius, quum possit videri de una transtulisse ?”
Why does Terence mention the ‘Perinthia' at all, when it was so
similar to the ‘ Andria’ that it would scarcely appear that he had copied
from more than one play? “Sic solvitur,’' answers Donatus; “quia
conscius sibi est primam scenam de Perinthia esse translatam, ubi
senex ita cum uxore loquitur ut apud Terentium cum liberto·, at in
Andria Menandri solus senex est.'’ From the account of Donatus it
appears that the ‘ Andria’ and ‘ Perinthia' resembled each other in the ’
first scene, and in two other passages of eleven and twenty verses in
length respectively. In this first scene itself the resemblance appears
to have been close, with this exception, that in the ‘ Andria' the old man
was-made to soliloquize; in the ‘ Perinthia’ herwas made to talk to his
wife, just as in Terence's ‘ Andria’ we have Sosia introduced merely for
the purpose of breaking the monotony of a soliloquy. See note on vv·
140—144.

And. i. 3. 12:

“Audireque eorum est operae pretium audaciam :
Nam inceptio est amentium haud amantium.'’

With these lines Meineke, following Grauert, compares the following
fragment of Menander:
τὸ δ’ ε’ρᾶν ἐπισκοτεῖ
ἅπασιν, ὥς ἔοικε, καὶ τοῖς εὐλόγως
καὶ τοῖς κακῶς ἔχουσι. (Fragm. Ἀνδ. i.)

The reader may [decide whether the resemblance i· close enough to fix

the ingtation of this passage upon Terence. The following is also not
very o vious.
