IN TRODUOTION . xvii

here on the general subject of the literary position of Terence, and
then to consider in detail the particular objections which were brought:
against him.

Rome in the time of Terence seems to have been divided into two literar-y
factions ;—-those who were for importing the elegant culture of Greece,
and transplanting its literature into the harder soil of Italy3 and those
who hel'd fast to the old ways, who loved the traditions of the Cethegi, ‚
and were for maintaining the rugged but vigorou's nationality of Fes-
cennine and Saturnian verse. As for imitation of Greek models, that
Δ could not be avoided. Plautus and his contemporaries had settled
that question; but there existed in their transcripts no shallow vein
of rough Roman wit, which maintained the rude independence of
the native Camenae. The Scipiones and the Laelii, Terence's friends
and patrous, were at the head of the “young Rome” of their day,
the movement party in politice, the “ Greeks'’ in literature. They
would turn from the rugged language and rude Jests of the Roman
poets to the exquisite diction and polished wit' of the Greeks. To this
’ party Terence was attached by social ties as well as b'y literary tastes.
His humour was evidently akin to that of Menander, quiet and sparkling,

just as Plautus reminds us more of the boisterous fun and audacity of

Aristophanes. He had set himself to work carefully in a finished style,
and to bring the Roman language into a more strict uniformity with the
laws ofrhythm than had been attained by any of his predecessorS. To
him, no doubt, the Greek language was the perfection of elegance and
refinement3 and he endeavoured to establish on the Roman stage a style
of Comedy that should in some measure possess these qualities. In this
attempt he would not only have to contend with the popular passion for
excitement, and with the existing taste which had been accustomed to
coarser food, but he had to overcome the opposition of apowerful and nu-
merous body. His opponents would be glad to attach themselves to the
conservatives of that day, the “ Trojans,’' to borrow a term from the his-
tory of our own literature‚—the party represented by the Fabii and by
Cato. For we may be sure that the more execrable poet a man was, the
more lustily 116 would denounce the innovator Terence ; the more he would
accuse him of being a. bad copyist of foreign models ; the more he would
⁵ decry his style as wanting in nerve and spirit. Such we may conceive
were the hangers-on to the party whose cry was “ Rome for the
