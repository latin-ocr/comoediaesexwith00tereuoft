Oh. Ohe, jam desine Deos, uxor, gratulando, obtundere,

Aer V. SCENE Ι. Menedemus comes on
the stage triumphing over Chremes. whom
he has now discovered to be after all one of
the most foolisn of men; and although he
allows that he himself is not very wise, yet
Chremes' folly surpasses all ordinary bounds
and exhausts the common vocabulary of
mankind. He now falls in with Chremes,
who inquires how his son took the news
of his consent to his marriage; and amuses
himself greatly with the thought of Syrus’
cunning, who can make a youngman pretend
to be pleased at the idea of an immediate
marriage when all the while he has his mis-
tress under his father's roof. But he is
rather disconcerted when he finds that
there was no bargaining for money in con-
sequence of this engagement, and is puzzled
at 11118. 10 1110 amusement of Menedemus,
who proceeds to punish him. ‘ Syrus you
said was a good manager. What do you
think? he has made your son play such a
cunning part that no one could ever for a
moment suspect that Clinia had any thing
to do with the woman. I only tell you what
1 and Clinia saw, and you may draw your
own conclusion.’ After this exposure of
1118 8011 Chremes loses all selfvpossession3
and the characters of the two men are
completely transposed. Chremes is now
for violence. He is angry at his stupidity,
and 0811 hardly be persuaded to 110 patient
with his son. The marriage of Clinia and
Antiphila is arranged, and Clitipho is to be
informed that all his father’s fortune is
settled upon his sister; that 110 may thus be
reduced to extremities. And as for Syrus,
he shall catch it for having treated him 88
110 would hardly have dared to treat a lone

woman.
The Metre is as follows3 1—34. 67 —813

trochaic tetrameter 0818100110 ;
iambic trimeter.

2. Sed hic adjutor mem et monitor etprae-
monstrator Chremen] ⁴ But Chremes here
my helper and prompter and master 18 su-
perior to me in this respect! These are
said by commentators to be terma borrowed
from the stage; but it is a curious instance
of the value of such general remarks, that
we hardly find a clear example of such 8
1180, except once of ⁴ adjutor ’ 111 Phaedrus,
v. 5. 13, 14:

‘¹ In scena vero postquam solus constitit

Sine apparatu, nullis adjutoribus,
Silentium ipsa fecit expectatio.''

35—66,

‘Monitor' was used of ‘aprompter' (see
note on i. l. 119), but particularly in courts
of justice or the forum. See Cicero, Divi-
natio In Q. Caecilium 16: ⁴⁴ Vides mihi
non te sed hunc librum esse responsurum
quem monitor tuus hic tenet.” ⁴ praemon-
stro ' is used in 8 similar manner in Plautus,
Persa i. 3. 67—70:

“ — Propera, abi domum ε
Praemonstra docte, praecipe astu filiae
Quid fabuletur, ubi se natam praedicet,
Qui sibi parentes fuerint, ut subrepta sitss’

3. In me quidvis harum rerum convenit
quae sum dieta in stultum] ⁸ Au and every
one of the ordinary epithets which are given
to 8 fool are applicable to me! Compare
Cicero. In C. Verrem ii. 1. 49: “ C. Verrem
insimulat avaritiae et audaciae, quae vitia
videntur in quemvis potius quam in istum
convenire! ’

6, Ohe, . . . yratutando obtundere]
Chremes is just leaving his house; and as
he comes out speaks to his wife, who can-
not be tired of offering up thanks to the
