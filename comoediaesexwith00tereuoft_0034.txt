xxviii ³ INTRODUOTION.

we are to call ‘ Habent de} ’ an anapaest. Many such cases will be noticed
in the course of the following remarks. What has been said is suffi-
cient to show the importance of examining fully the pronunciation of
the Roman language at the time of Terence and Plautus. This subJect
has been noticed by the author of the ‘ Varronianus’ (chap. x.), who
refers to the ‘Journal of Education’ (vol. 11. p. 344, &c.), where it
is treated generally in a manner which leaves nothing for others.
For the general principles of Latin pronunciation, as exhibited in the
shortened forms of the tenses of verbs, of compound words, of words
united by juxta-position, I may refer to those treatises. My own object
is to examine this question in reference especially to Terence—from
whom both the writers above mentioned have drawn many of their
illustrations-and to ascertain from his writings, irrespectively of other
60111666, 601116 at least of the most marked peculiarities of the pronun-
ciation of the Latin‘language. We may lay it down generally that the
language of Terence is that of the common conversation of middle life,
removed no less from the reflnement of the educated scholar than from
the rustic patois which we may often observe in Plautus. This dif-
ference is no more than we should expect from the circumstances of the
two poets. Plautus working at the mill for his livelihood, and Terence,
the reputed friend of Scipio and Laelius, were likely to present 116 with
very different specimens of the language of their day. Terence’s cha-
racters talk as the respectable Roman of that day talked. Even his
slaves and maid-servants are not vulgar.

Passing then to details, I shall first examine the language of Terence,
and then his metres. Under the first inquiry will fall the pronun-
ciation of his words, and the various usages which go by the name of
‘poetic licences,’ many of them not‘so much licences as examples of the
common pronunciation of the Latin language. l

The first case which I shall notice is that of CONTBAOTION of two
syllables or vowels into one, known by grammarians as ‘ 81111666163 of
which several classes may be distinguished.

⁸ 1 have adopted the general divisions given by Lindemann in his preface to his edition
of the ‘ Miles Gloriosus,’ &c., and by Ritschl in his ‘ Prolegomena.' Ι need not say that
my instances are due to my own examination of the text of Terence.
