Romans? ’whose great light was Plautus3 who praised his Roman wit
and national phraseology and manners.

The difficulty of Terence’ s position lay 1n this, that he was endea-
vouring to recall the popular taste from the broad farce which had been
so happily introduced by Plautus to amore artistic model ; from the rude
wood-cuts as it were os popular :fun and low life to the finished line
engravings of classic dialogue. Terence aimed at an improvement of the
public taste, he sought to educate as well as to please‚-a difficult task in
those early days of the Drama. Imagine a temporary scaffolding in the
centre of the amphitheatre, with all the distractions of the Great Games, ’
—boxing matches, the tight rope, and above all the gladiatoria] contests,
ever the true poetry of the Roman people,—and you will see that Roman
Comedy must needs have been rather rude to hold its ground with the
multitude. Under such circumstances, and with such an audience
Plautus is, and will continue to be popular, sor he swims with the
stream, and is carried on merrily on its surface, while he “expressa
arbusto regerit convicia,'’ and clothes even his most foreign personages
with a good homely mantle of Roman wit and phraseology. Terence,
on the contrary, is endeavouring to force the stream backwards, or
rather to turn it from a living gushing river of broad life and merri-
ment into an ornamental lake, laid out according to the-true laws
of art, and reflecting column and terrace, and well—ordered ranks of
cypresses and urns. It is interesting and not uninstructive to compare
his struggles in the cause of art with Moliere’s early attempts to gain 3
recognition for a very different school of Oomedy in the palmy days of
the unities and consistencies of the legitimate Drama. Their objects-
were very different, and so was their success3 but this is easily to be
accounted for by the preceding consideration, that the efforts of Moliere
were in unison with the natural though repressed sympathies of the ’
. people, while the plays of Terence, however highly appreciated by
competent judges, must have always been to some extent φωνᾶντα
συνετοῖσιν, ἐς δὲ τὸ πᾶν ἑρμηνέων χατίζοντα.

We now come to the particular charges against Terence. They fall
under three heads3—l. Plagiarism from Greek copies both in subject
and in the characters of his plays (see Prol. to Andria, Eunuchus, ‘and
Heautontimorumenos) 3—2. The aid of distinguished friends (Prol. to
Adelphi and Heautontimorumenos, v. 24) ;—3. The want of spirit and
