32. Diminuetur tibi quidem jam cere-
brum] ‘ You will get your head broken 111 a
minute! On ⁴ diminuetur ' see note on
Eunuchus iv. 7. 33. ⁴ Ita ' should 116 placed,
as Faern says, at the end of the preceding
line ; 61111 both lines are then trochaic cata-
lectic as the rest of the scene.

35. Praeterito hac recta platea sursum]
Colman quotes Theobald, who remarks in
his edition of Shakespeare that this direction
of Syrus may have given rise to Shake-
speare’s similar passage ¹in the “ Merchant of
Venice, '⁷ Act ii. Sc. 2:

‘Gom Master, young gentleman, Ι
pray 2you, which is the way to master
Jevlviduncelot. Turn up on your right hand

a at the next turning, but at the next turning

of all on your left; marry, at the very next
turning. turn off no hand, but turn down
indirectly to the Jew's house.

Gobbo. By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard
way to hit.’'

37. Anyiportum] See note on Eunu-
chus v. 2. 6.

40. Censen hominem me esse ἕ] ‘ Do you
take me for a man? I made a mistake.
Go back again to the portico. You will
find that 6 11111011 nearer way; and there is
less likelihood of missing your road! The
meaning of‘ homo’ here is not very evi-
dent. Donatus says, “Mire 56 negat homi-
nem3 tanquam homo corde sit non cor-

pore.'’ Other commentators too explain
the words in the same way, 65 ‘Whata
fool I am !' Cicero uses the word in much
the same manner, Epist. ad Atticum ii. 2:
‘⁴ Ἡρώδης 51 homo esset eum potius legeret
quam unam scriberet,'’ ⁴ 1f he had the sense
of a man‚' and this is part of the mean-
ing of the word in i. 2. 27:

‘⁴ Et tu illum tuum, si esses homo,
Sineres nunc facere.”

It is better however to explain the words
‘Do you consider me 6 111611 οι· 110.>’ὰ
Syrus sum non Deus—⁸ Ι 6111 only a man,
and therefore liable to error.' ‘Ne ’ often
implies in direct questions an affirmative
answer, and is nearly equivalent to ‘ nonne!
See Long's note on Cicero, In C. Verrem
ii. 2. 46. It is especially used in this way
where it is attached to the principa] verb in
the sentence. ‘Porticus’ is derived from
‘ portus ’ in its sense of a ⁴ private house '
(note on Eunuchus v. 2. 6). Portiones
were common in private houses3 and there
were also many such public oolonnades in
Greek towns and at Rome,which were used
for exercise and shelter. They are alluded
to in various places by Horace and other
writers. Probably the word is here a trans-
lation of the Greek στοὰ, which was not
confined to a cloister or colonnade, but was
used also for various buildings, probably of
an oblong form, and supported by pillars.
