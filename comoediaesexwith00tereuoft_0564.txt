490 TERENOE AND THE N EW OOMEDY.

that of Meineke in his note on Menander, Fragm. Fab. Inoert. oDx.
Epimetrum iii. pp. 709, 710. He conceives that the name of Apollo,
Λοξίας, must have been mentioned by Menander, as the altar was
dedicated to him (see my note on the passage), and thav the word lies
hid in the corrupt reading Δήλιον or Cassion of Donatus’ text( He

accordingly reads:

ἀπὸ Λοξία σὺ μυῤῥίνας τασδὶ [λαβὼν]

υπΟΤΕινΕ.
We may notice that the same fragment has been interpreted by
Bentley ἀπὸ δεξιᾶς σὺ μυῤῥίνης κλάδους λάβε, and by Jacobs, ἀφ’ ἑστίας
σὺ μυῤῥίνας δέχου Δυστηνέ. It is not for us to decide between these

differing masters of their craft.
And. iv. 5. 9, in answer to the question of Crito:

“ Quid vos Ρ quo pacto hic? satin recte 5³⁹⁹

Mysis answers:
“ —— Nosne? ‘ Sic

Ut quimus,' aiunt, ‘ quando ut volumus non licet.’ ”

With this is justly compared the fragment of Menander which ¹occurs
in Monostich. 190, and is placed by Meineke expressly among the
fragments of his Ἀνδρέα, xiii.: - ⁷

Ι Ζῶμεν γὰρ οὐχι ὡς θέλομεν, ἀλλ’ ὡς δυνάμεθα.

In addition to these more express quotations we have a number of less ’ - -,

striking instances, consisting of short phrases or mere allusione,
gathered from the notes of Donatus and Eugraphius. Such are the

following z

“ Nihil me fallis.'’ (And. i. 2. 33.)
Οὐδέν με λανθάνοις ἅν. (Mein. Fragm. Ἀνδρ. iii.)
“ Ne me obsecra.'’ (And. iii. 3. 11.)

Μὴ λιτάνευε, μὴ μάχου.
This last is doubtful. See Meineke, Fragm. Ἀνδρ. vii.:
“ Quidnam audio ?” (And. iii. 4. 3,)

where Donatus notices another reading, ‘ audiam‚’ agreeing with the
¹words of Menander, τί δή ποτ’ ἇκούσω;

“ Sic, Crito, hic est.’' (And. v. 4. 16.)
οὕτως αὑτός ἐστι. (Mein. Fragm. Ἀνδρ. xii.)

And on Andria iii. 1. 15:

“ J uno Lucina fer opem‚”
