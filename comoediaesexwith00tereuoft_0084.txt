house, which stands on one wing of the
stage, carrying with them their kitchen
stuff. Sosia remains armed with his cook-
ing utensils. The absence of stage direc-
tions has in some instances given rise to
difficulties in the intrepretation of Terence.
We cannot doubt that the poet had an eye
throughout to stage effect ς but the manage-
ment of the dialogue would rest mainly with
his chief actors Ambivius and Attilius. The
success of a play would depend much on the
spirit which they exhibited in their render-
ing of it3 for every elever actor has it in his
power to give a new dress to the works of
his author. Thus we find the actor who
speaks the second prologue to the Hecyra
claiming the merit of having established the
reputation of Caecilius by his performanoes,
‘⁶ Novas qui exactas feci ut inveterascerent.'’
He was manager and actor at once, and
proprietor of the play too, and would natu-
rally do his best to make it attractive.

5. Ietae arte] ⁴ I want none of your skill
in the matter which I have in hand! This
marked sense of ⁴ iste ' as the demonstrative
of the second person meets us throughout
Terence. Compare Heaut- i. l. 58, ‘ Istuc
aetati& ⁴ when I was at your age! Hence is
derived the judicial use of the word signifying
the defendant. See Long’s note on Cicero In
Verrem ii. 3. 87. The words used by Terence
are ambiguous, and may be applied either to
domestic skill or in a more general sense.

9. Juxta et clemens servitus] ‘Clementia'
belongs more properly to the imposer of
service than to the service itself. We
may, however, compare other phrases in
which there is a similar transfer of ideas.
Thus in Tacitus, Ann. i. 81 ε “ Quantoque
majore libertatis imagine tegebantur, tanto
eruptura ad infensius servitium,” ⁴ a more

15

galling slavery! Ann. xi. 10: ‘⁴ Ingens
gloria, atque eo ferocior et subjectis intole-
ratior.'' So here, ‘you know how reasonable
and indulgent my rule over you has been.'
But Terence may mean simply ‘ easy,' as in
Adelphi i. 1. 17: ‘⁴ Ego hanc clementem
vitam urbanam atque otium Secutus sum.''

from Menander: ἐγώ σε δοῦλον ὄντ’ ἔθηκ’
ἐλεύθερον.

Ε servo] Compare Horat. Serm. ii. 5. 55:
“ Plerumque recoctus Scriba ex quinque-
viro corvum deludet hiantem,” where see
Macleane’s note. Virgil, Aen. x. 221 : ⁴· Nu-
men ’habere maris, nymphasque e navibus
esse!

11. Liberaliter] Compare “Servum haud
illiberalem praebes te,'' Adelphi v. 5. 5, ‘ I

made you free because you showed that you
merited freedom.'

13. Haud muto factum] ¹ I do not re-
pent the deed.’ Compare Adelphi iv. 7. 19:
“ Placet tibi sactum, Micio? Non si queam
Mutare.'' So ‘ mutare fidem,’ Phormio
iii. 2. 27 ; Sallust, Jug. 52; Livy xxxi.
28, ⁴ to break a promise.' Bentley reads
‘ Haud muto. S. Factum gaudeo! ‘Muto ' is
found absolutely, as in Plautus, Rud. iii. 6,
27, but the change creates an unnecessary
abruptness. Donatus mentions an old read-
ing ‘multo,' which is adopted by Reiu-
hardt 3 but this is harsh‚ and has not been
followed by others. At Athens slaves who
were manumitted were liable to be prose·
cuted sor a neglect of their duties to their
former masters, who stood in the relation
of προστάται to them. Such a prosecu-
tion was called ἀποστασίου δίκη. (See Dict.
of Ant. p. 705, a.)
