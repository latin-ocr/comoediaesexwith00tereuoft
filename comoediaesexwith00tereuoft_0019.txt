IN TRODUCTION . xiii

Itaque a conspectu omnium abiit in Graeciam, in terram ultimam.
Mortuus est in Stymphale, Arcadiae oppido: nihil Publius

Scipio profuit, nihil ei Laelius, nihil Furius;

Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime.

Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conducticiam ;

Saltem ut esset quo referret obitum domini servu] us.”

These are the few facts which have been recorded of the life and career of
Terence. We can only endeavour to fill up the blank by conjecture. Ι
may, however, here offer a few remarks on the narrative as it is handed
down to us.

The story of his servitude is open to considerable objection. With this
ζ has been mixed up another tale, that he walked in the triumphal procession
³ of Scipio Africanus after his return from the conquest of Carthage, as a
liberated Roman citizen. But, setting aside the historical anachronism of
this story, it seems most probable that the Terentius here referred to
was one Terentius Culeo, a noble Roman, of senatorian rank, who was
among the many Roman captives brought back by Scipio from captivity
at Carthage. We cannot certainly say whether Terence was a Car-
thaginian at all. His eminence as a Latin writer is not indeed inconsistent
with an humble or foreign origin3 but the fact of his possessing property
of some extent, and the connexion formed by his daughter, seem to
go against the common story of his extreme poverty. We can hardly
suppose that his literary success was so great as to put himin possession
of a handsome fortune, or to enable him to make any great purchases of
land. The ‘ Eunuchus ’ was considered to fetch a remarkable sum,
eight thousand sesterces, equivalent to about 2264 10⁸. of our money,
and at this rate his plays could not have afforded him a very ample
livelihood. We should rather conclude from the recorded events of his
life, as far as their value can be estimated, that he must have been in a
position to make literature his profession, and to follow his profession
with a sense of his duty to his art, rather than as a mere means of
making money. The tone which he takes in all 1118 Prologues is that of
an independent author, who feels himself above thc necessity of courting
popularity, and who is determined to write according to his own views
of poetry. He complains that his enemies sought to condemn him to
idleness and obscurity 3 but he does not once hint at any pecuniary loss “
to himself from their opposition. And this view of his pecuniary
