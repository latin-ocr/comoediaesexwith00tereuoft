In utramque partem ingenium quid possit meum.
Si nunquam avare pretium statui arti meae,
Et eum esse quaestum in animum induxi maximum,

CHREMES.

SOENA PRIMA.

MENEDEMUS.

Ch. Quanquam haec inter nos nupera notitia admodum est,
Inde adeo quod agrum in proximo hic mercatus es,

Nec rei fere sane amplius quicquam fuit3

Tamen vel virtustua me, vel vicinitas,

Quod ego in propinqua parte amicitiae puto,

and in the stataria. 1 have been tried in
the Eunuchus, see now what Ι can do in a
very different style.' The commentary of
Donatus on this play has been lost, and
with it his testimony to the ancient state of
the text. Calphurnius (1460 mn.) in his
commentary has imitated the style of Do-
natus ; but he had no better means of form·-
ing a judgment on the text or the meaning
of Terence than we have. We still have the
diffuse paraphrases of EugraphiuS, which
however are not often valuable in a critical

point of view.

Acr I. Sann Ι. Chremes finding Me-
nedemus still hard at work on his farm, as
he has observed him to be for some time
past, at length ventures to address him on
,the subject. What can be his reason ? He
is too‘old for such work. No one has a
better property in all the neighbourhood;
and if work enough is not done on the farm,
time would be much better spent in looking
after others than in working himself. Me-
ne'demus at first sullenly rejects interfe-
rence ; but after some expostulation he ex-
plains to Chremes that he does all this to
punish himself for his conduct to his son.
He had been very severe towards him, and
the consequence was that the young man,
thwarted in his love, went off to Asia to
serve under the king. After this event his
father could no longer bear to live in luxury
while his son was roughing it in a foreign

5

land. He sold his house and servants, and
took to hard out-of-doors labour. Chremes
endeavours to encourage him with the hope
of his son’s speedy return, and tries to en-
tice him away from his work, but in vain.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

l. Quanquam haee . . . mercatus ee]
‘ Although our present acquaintance is quite
recent, commencing in a word from the
time when you bought this farm in my
neighbourhood.’ Ι have adopted the read-
ing of the Bembine manuscript, ‘nupera.’
Compare Plautus, Captivi iii. 5. 60: ‘⁸ Re.-
cens captum hominem, nuperum, novicium.”
Other copies have ⁸ nuper,’ but I do not
find a single instance of ‘nuper ¹ used in the
sense of ‘ recens! ⁴ Admodum ' literally
means ⁴ up to the measure,' ⁴ quite‚'and hence
is generally used to strengthen the sense of
the word to which it is attached. This is
its usual sense in prose writers. In Terence
it occurs sometimes in this sense. Compare
Adelphi iii. 3. 49: ‘⁴ Iratum admodum ;’'
and Phormio iii. l. 132 ‘¹ Confutavit verbis
admodum iratum senem.'’ We have a
rather different sense in Hecyra iii. 5. 8:
“Advenis modo? Pa. Admodum ;'’ ‘just
so 3’ and Phormio ii. 2. l.

5. Quod eqo in propinqua parte ami·-
ciliae puto] ‘Which I consider to be next
door to friendship! Bentley objects to this
phrase ¹ in propinqua parte amicitiae,' and
proposes ‘quod ego esse in aliqua parte
amicitiae puto ι’ but Zeune very well shows
