Illancine mulierem alere cum illa familia P

Etsi scio hosce aliquot dies non sentiet3

Ita magno desiderio fuit ei filius ε 5
Verum ubi videbit tantos sibi sumtus domi

Quotidiano fieri, nec fieri modum,

Optabit rursum ut abeat ab se filius.

Syrum optime eccum! Sy. Cesso hunc adoriri Ρ Oh. Syre.

Sy. De illo quod dudum? dictum ac factum reddidi.

Oh. Bonane fide Ρ Sy. Bona hercle.

Accede huc, Syre ε

Faciam boni tibi aliquid pro ista re, ac libens. 15
Sy. At si scias, quam scite in mentem venerit.

3. Illaricine mulierem alere cum illa
familia ἴ] ‘To think that he 'has to feed
that woman, with all those servants of hers 1’
‘ Familia ' is here used in its true etymolo-
gical sense ‘ a household of slaves,’ as δου-
λεία and οἰκία in Greek authors. Compare
Livy viii. 15: “Minucia Vestalis, cum in
suspicionem venisset impudicitiae, jussa est
a pontificibus sacris abstinere, familiamque
in potestate habere :” she was forbidden to
liberate her slaves, for their evidence might
be required at her trial. In Phaedrus iii.
19, we have ‘ familia ’ used of a single
slave :—“ Aesopus domino solus cum esset
familia,” ‘ Where Aesop was the only
household his master had) Cicero uses the
word more than once in the same general
sense. For the infinitive see notes on
Eunuchus iv. 3. 23 ii. 1. 3, and Andria i. 5.

5. Ita mayno desiderio fuit ei filius]
Bentley objects to this verse on the ground
that ‘ fuit ' should be ‘ est,' for Menedemus
has not yet got over his longing for his son.
But the perfect exactly expresses what
Bentley wishes. The feeling was long
cherished and still exists. Nor is there
much force in his objection to the word
‘filius' because it is repeated three lines
after. The line, is recognized by all autho-
rities, and is quite entitledto keep its place.

7. Quotidiano] This reading is due to
Bentley. We find the word used adver-
bially in Plautus, Captivi iii. 5. 65-67 z

‘⁸ Inde ibis porro in latomias lapidarias:

Ibi ‘quum alii octonos lapides effodiunt,
Qtildtsildiano sesquiopus confeceris,
Sexcentoplago nomen indetur tibi;”

and Cicero, In C. Verrem ii. 4. 8: ‘⁴ Habi-
tasti apud Heium Messanae: res illum divi-
nas apud eos deos in suo sacrario pe
quotidiano facere vidisti.” (See Mr. Long's
note.) In the passage of Plautus there is
of course a variety of reading-3 for it would
be strange if some transcribers had not sub·
stituted amore common word for the nn-
common, as no doubt has been done here.
In most cases the harder reading commenda
itself to our judgment.

12. Dictum ac sactum reddidi] ‘Yon
seem,' says Chremes, ‘to have been suc-
cessful with the old man in some way or
other.' ‘Do you mean,’ says Syrus, ‘in
the matter of which we spoke some time
since ?' ⁴ Yes, 1 have done it all as we
said! The words ‘dictum ac factum,' or
‘ dictum factum,' are generally used adver·
bially, as in v. l. 31, and Andria ii. 3. 7
(note). Here they are the object of the
verb, and we should translate them literally
⁴ Ι made it said and done‚’ as Eugraphins
explains it ι “ Cum dixisses factum continuo
reddidi.''

13. Non possum pati quin tibi caput
demulceam] ¹ Ι cannot help caroesing yon!
This is the only passage where this phrase
occurs; but its meaning is sufficiently ob-
mous.
