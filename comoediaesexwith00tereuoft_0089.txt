the opening 000110 of “ Twelfth Night :''

Shakspere, however, spoils the idea by the
artificial dress which 110 gives it.

89. Nihil suspicans etiam mali] Not
mpecting any hai-m ‘as yet) ‘Etiam’ is
here used as ‘etiam nunc;' and again in
iii. 2. 23: ‘⁴ Non satis pernosti me etiam ;”
Hecyra iv. 3. 8: ‘⁶ De uxore incertus sum
etiam quid sim facturus ;” and Virg. Aen. vi.
⁴8⁶ ε “ Etiam currus etiam arma tenentem.''

¹algpropriated to the ceremonies of funerals.

us in Livy i. 59, we have ‘⁴ Elatum domo
Lucretiae corpus in forum deferunt ;'' aster
1110 Greek ὶκφέρειν. Τ110 word ‘ 00 ’ was also
used in 1110 same way. Thus in Phormio
v. 8. 37, we have 0 kind of parody of a
fimeral proclamation ε “ Exequias Chremeti
quibus est commodum ire hem tempus
est.” Terence is blamed for an inconsistency
in making Simo follow the funeral (v. 101),
the Athenian custom 1101113· 11101 1110 men
went before the corpse, the women behind.
But this supposes 11101 Simo joined the pro-
00001011, which is not necessarily implied in
the words ‘in funus prodeo,’ but rather that
110 went out as a mere spectator. At any
rate Terence is consistent in placing him

near the women, both before and after their
arrival at the pyre. Nor must we demand
of the Roman drama 100 exact an observ-
ance of such minor consistencies.

96. Pedisequos] Τ110 ⁴ pedisequi ’ were of
the lowest class of slaves. Compare Plautus,
Miles Gloriosus iv. 2. 20 ι “Pedisequus tibi
sum.'' Here the word is used more loosely
in the sense of ⁴ fouower!

98. Illieo] This word, which is of very
frequent occurrence in Terence and Plautus,
is derived from ‘in loco,' ¹ on the spot,' ⁴ at
once,’ ‘immediately.' It is said that ‘ per-
cussit ' is especially used of suspicion, love,
&c., and ‘ perculsit ⁹ of sear and the 1ike3
but the two words are often confounded by
copyists (see Macleane's note on Horace,
Epod. xi. 2); and in the uncertainty of
texts we cannot 0111 011011 0 theory.

99. Hinc illae lacrumae] These words
passed into a proverb. See Horace, Epist.
i. 19. 41, and Cicero, Pro Caelio, 0. 25.

101. Aa sepulerum venimus] ‘Sepul-
crum' denotes the place where the body
was to be burnt, sometimes also called
‘sepultura,' more generally ⁴ rogus! We
find ‘sepulcrum ’ and ‘rogus ’ in Proper-
tius, v. 11. 1, 8, used in a·metaphorical
sense for the ⁴ manes ' of the dead. Τ110
word ⁸ sepelio,' like the Greek θάπτω, has
a gener-ic sense, and includes the whole
various modes of funeral, whether by
burial or by burning. See Livy vii. 24:
‘⁴ Sepultum Consentiae quod membrorum
reliquum fuit.'' similarly ⁴ humo ' is some-
times used for ⁴ cremo! The whole scene
of this funeral is clearly translated from the
