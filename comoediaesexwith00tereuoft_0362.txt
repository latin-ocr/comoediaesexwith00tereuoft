18. Tam placidum quam ovem reddo]
‘ Ι know his humour well. When he is at
boiling pitch I make him as quiet as a
lamb.' This is an instance of a common
kind of attraction. The fuller expression
would be ‘quam ovis est‚' as in Plautus,
Poenulus i. 2. 145, 146:

‘⁶ Tam hercle tu peristi ni illam mihi tam
tranquillam facis
Quam mare est olim quum ibi alcedo
pullos educit suos,’'

and in this play, v. 3. 63: ‘⁴ Tam excoctam
reddam atque atram quam carbo est.’' We
have the same construction in Phormio iv.

21:

‘¹ Ego hominem callidiorem vidi neminem
Quam Phormionem.”

There is no need therefore to read with
, Bentley ‘ quam ovis est.’ He takes avery

literal view of the words, “ Ovis non reddi-
, tur placida: quia non ex sera cicuratur et
mansuescit, sed est natura et indole pla-
cida.” Most of our metaphors would fall
to the ground under such a criticism as
this. In the preceding line the best autho-
rities have ‘fervit-⁹ ⁴ Ferveo ’ follows the
third declensiou in some casce, particularly
in the infinitive mood.

19. Facio te apud illum Deum] We
find this expression used by Cicero in sober
prose: -“ Qui ordo tibi placeat, inquit Ca-
tulus, et quae dispositio argumentorum, in
qua tu mihi semper Deus videri soles‚” De
Oratore ii. 42. Plato informs us that the
phrase was a common one with the Spar-

tans ε καὶ αἵγε γυναῖκες δήπου, ὦ Μένων,
τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας θείους καλοῦσι. Καὶ
οὶ Λάκωνες ὅταν τινὰ ἐγκωμιάζουσιν ἀγα-
Θὸν ἄνδρα, θεῖος ἀνὴρ, φασὶν, οὗτος,
Meno. p. 99, a practice alluded to by Aris·
totle (Ethie. Nicom. vii. 1. 3), who gives
the true vernacular, Σεῖος ἀνὴρ. In mere
flattery, applied to great men, the word was
in common use in Rome at a later period.
21. Hem tibi autem] ‘ But mind your
yourself. What is it ? The old story. Talk
of the devil.' Cicero uses the same proverb,
Epist, ad Atticum xiii. 33: “De Varrone
loquebamur ε Lupus in fabula. Venit enim
ad me.” Plautus has it in a rather dif-
ferent form z ‘¹ Atque eccum tibi lupum in
sermone !’' Stichus iv. 1. 71. The origin
of the saying is not clearly ascertained.
Servius connects it with the popular super-
stition that the sight os a wolf deprived a
person of speech, as in virgil, Eclog. ix.

“ — Vox quoque Moerim .
Jarggigit ipsa, lupi Moerim videre pri-

and so he says the proverb is applied to the
appearance of one of whom we are talking.
who cuts short our conversation by his
arrival. In default of a better explanation
we must receive this.
sometimes in the sense of ‘sermo3' but in
later authors. Donatus gives another ex-
planation, derived from the stories of ‘ wolf '
with which nurses would frighten children3
but that is not the sense of this passage.

‘Fabula’ is used ⁶
