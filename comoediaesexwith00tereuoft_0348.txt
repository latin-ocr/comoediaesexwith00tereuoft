trata. Ge. Ah,

Me miserum! vix sum compos animi3 ita ardeo iracundia.

Nihil est quod malim quam illam totam familiam mihi dari
obviam

Ut ego iram hanc' m eos evomam omnem dum aegritudo haec
est recens:

Satis mihi id habeam supplici, dum illos ulciscar modo. 15

Seni animam primum extinguerem ipsi qui illud produxit
scelus.

Tum autem Syrum impulsorem, vah, quibus illum lacerarem
modis 1

Sublimem medium arriperem, et capite pronum in terram sta-
merem,

Ut cerebro dispergat viam.

Adolescenti ipsi eriperem oculos3 posthaec praecipitem da-
rem · ο

Caeteros ruerem, agerem, raperem, tunderem, et prosternerem.

Sed cesso heram hoc malo impertiri propere Ρ So. Revoce— ,
mus. Geta.

16. Seni] Commentators dispute which
old man is meant, Micio or Demea. But
we must. remember that Geta need not be
supposed to know the history of Aeschinus’
adoption by Micio, 61111 116 would naturally
conclude that they were father and son.
There is 110 occasion therefore for refining 011
the meaning of ⁶ produxit‚’ as has been done
b some.

y18. Sublimem medium arriperem] ‘1
‘would seize him by the middle and lift
him up in the air, and then plant him
head foremost on the ground, that he
may sprinkle the road with his braina!
For ‘mblimem’ compare Andria v. 2. 20.
In Plautus, Captivi, 116 have an obscure
expression which is illustrated by the
textz

“ 1111111101- interminorque ne quis obstiterit
Nissi'gniimssst diu vixisse sese homo arbi-
trabitur.

Nam qui obstiterit ore sistetss'
iv. 2. 11—13.

In Herodotus ix. 1⁰7, we have the same
idiom: καί μιν ἐπιθέοντα φρασθεὶς Ξεινα-

γόρης ὁ Πρηξίλεω, ἀνὴρ Ἀλικαρνησσειίς,
ὅπισθε“ εστεὼς αὐτοῦ Ἀρταΰντεω, ἁρπάζει
μέσον nai εξᾴρας παίει εἰς τὴν γῆν.

,8611 cesso heram hoc malo impertiri
propere ?] ‘But why don’ t 1 make haste
and communicate this bad news to my mis—
tress. >⁹ We meet with the depo nent form
of this verb in Cicero, Pro ΡΟΑ161116 5·

“Multis. gratuito civitatem in Graecia
homines impertiebantur.'’ The word has
occurred in Eun. ii. 2. 40, with the 66616
construction of accusative of the person
and ablative of the thing-3 which is used
once in Plautus with the similar word, ‘ com·-
munico‚' Mil. Glor. i. l. 50 : ‘⁴ Communicabo
te mensa mea.'' In the next line commen-
tators have found 6 difficulty in the 1111611111·
stance of Geta's not recognizing Sostrata.
Donatus says, “Vix nunc agnoscitur ab
irato! But Geta is represented 66 being
in a general state of confusion in which 116
might easily not 666 any 0116 who was 11661·
him. It was a common practical joke to
call aster 6 slave who was in a hun-y,
which is auuded to frequently in Pinum
and Terence.
