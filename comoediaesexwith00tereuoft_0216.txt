Grammar, 296 b. But according to Pro-
fessor Key (Lat. Gr. 950) the forms ‘ dorni,'
‘ belli,’ ⁴ militiai‚’ ‘ humi,' ‘ Romai‚’ διο. are
datives. The fact that all these ⁴ adverbs,'
as the old grammarians called them, have
the common ending ‘i’ points to the true
explanation that they are remnants of the

obsoleta locative case of the Indo-Germanic u

stock ς which appears also in such forms as
‘rm-i, ' ‘Carthagini' The locative would
approach the form of the dative in the third
declension, and of the genitive in the first
and second; and therefore some confound
them with one, some with the other.

46. Jamdudum animus est in patinis]
‘My mind is long ago upon the dishes!
Lindenbrog quotes from Athenaeus, Deip-
nos. i. a line of Alexis :

ὁ νοῦς γάρ ἐστι τῆς τραπέζης πλησίον.

Aer V. SCENE I. Thais attacks Pythias
about Dorus. What is the meaning of all
this prevarication? Here is Pamphila in
the utmost distress and disorder; and the
eunuch is gone off. Pythias explains what
she has heard from Dorus, that it was
Chaerea who had been introduced into their
house, and who had been left alone with
Pamphila by Thais’ own orders. At this
moment they see Chaerea approaching, still
in the clothes of Dorus, which he has not
yet had an opportunity of getting rid of.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

1. Peryin scelesta mecum perplexe Io-
qui?] ‘will you persist, you wretch, in

speaking ambiguously? 1 know—I don’t
know—he is gone—I heard—I was not
there.’ ⁴ Perplexe ’ is particularly used of
contradictory, ambiguous lauguage. Com-
pare Plautus, Asinaria iv. 1. 47: “Neque
ullum verbum faciat perplexabile ;” and Au-
lularia ii. 2. 81 z

At scio, quo vos soleatis perplexarIer.
Paetum non pactum est, non pactum pac·
tum est, quod vobis lubet.''

 

In Stichus i. 2. 18 we find the adven-bid
form ‘ perplexim!

4. Obticet] On this word Donatus re-
marks as follows. “Tac-mue consilia. ut
Aen. ii. 94, ‘Nec tacui demens·’ retice-
mus dolores· ut ⁶ ne verere, ne retice’
(Heaut. i. l. 33, ne retice ne verere'), ob-
ticemus quorum nos pudet. ut in P’hoe-
mione ‘ Heu quidnam obtices ?' ’¹ Donatus
probably refers to Phormio v. 8. 2, where

some copies give ‘⁸ Hem quid nunc obii· . -

cuisti?'' but the best reading is ‘obsti-
puisti! But these distinctions are not

observ-,ed In Heaut. v. l. 64, 65, we have

“Quid dotis dicam te dixisse filiae?
Quid obticuisti. ²’'

and Horace, Ars Poetica 284:
“ Lex est accepta, chorusque
Turpiter obticuit sublato· jure nocendi, ” ’

 

with other instances quoted by Forcellini.
8. Qui Chaerea .⁷] ‘What Chaerea. ’¹
Thais had never heard of him before. For
the use of ‘qui’ compare Plautus, Mostel-
laria⁴ iv. 3. 22· “Qui Philolaches? ” ‘Quis
