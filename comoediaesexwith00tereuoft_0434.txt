Quem ego tum consilio missum feci: idem nunc huic operam

dabo.

Adest Parmeno cum pueris :

hunc minime est opus

In hac re adesse ; nam olim soli credidi 50
Ea me abstinuisse in principio, 011111 data est.

Vereor, si clamorem ejus 1110 crebro audiat,

Ne parturire intelligat: aliquo mihi est

Hinc ablegandus dum parit Philumena.

AOTUS TERTII SGENA QUARTA.

PARME No.

SOSIA.

PAMPHILUS.

Par. Ain tu tibi 11οο incommodum evenisse iter P

So. Non hercle verbis, Parmeno, dici potest

Tantum quam re ipsa navigare incommodum est.

Par. Itane est Ρ So. Ο fortunate, nescis quid mali
Praeterieris qui nunquam es ingressus mare. 5
Nam alias ut omittam miserias, unam hanc vide :

Compare Cicero, In C. Verrem ii. 5. 542
“ Sex lictores circumsistunt valentissimi et
ad pulsandos verberandosque homines ex-
ercitatissimi.'’ De Officiis ii. 15: “Deinde
consuetudine beneficentiae paratiores erunt

et tanquam exercitatiores ad bene de multis
promerendum.’'

50. Nam olim soli credidi] See i. 2.
40, &c. Colman objects that this is a
serious over-sight in Terence. He supposes
that Parmeno was already acquainted with
the fact that Philumena had gone to her
mother’s house to conceal the birth of her
child. But there is no ground for this sup·-
position. As far as the plot of the play is
eonem-ned, this circumstance does not come
out till the present scene. All that Parmeno
knew was that Pamphilus and his wife had
not lived together during the early part of
their union. There is no hint that Pam-
philus himself had the least suspicion of
the real state of the 08εο till the present
moment.

54. Ableqandus] The word is commonly
used in this sense, of sending out of the
way any one whose presence is undesirable.
Compare Plautus, Miles Gloriosus iii. 2.
Hunc subcustodem suum
Foras ablegavit, dum eapse huc trans-

iret.” ·

 

Aci- 111. Souna IV.. Parmeno now re-

turns with the servants who were carrying
Pamphilus' baggage from the vessel 111 which
he had returned home. He is talking with
Sosia about the disagreeables of a sea voyage.
Pamphilus meets him with a new errand as
soon as he arn‘ves. He is to run over to
the Acropolis, and look for his friend Calli-
demides, and tell him that he is unable to
keep his appointment with him. His ap·
pearance is fully described, and Parmeno is
instructed to wait for him if necessary till
the evening.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

3. Tantum quam . . . incommodum eet]
‘ It is impossible, Parmeno, that words can
express the full extent os the troubles os a
sea voyage! We find the phrase ¹ tantus—
quam ' in other places. See Livy vii. 352
“Nec in acie tantum ibi cladis acceptum
quam quod trecentos septem milites Ro-
manos captos Tarquinienses immolarunt ;''
and xxvi. l ε “ Νοι1 ab ira tantum . . .
issffiiffissdsumabissssssrfffflssussi ΐοῗίῗοῗῖῗέ
recepta inclinatura rursus animos videbatur
ad veteris imperii respectum.” The com-
mentatore quote from Posidippus:

ὁ μὴ πεπλευκὼς οὐδὲν ἑώρακε κακὸν,
and from Menander:

πῦρ καὶ θάλασσα emi γυνὴ, κακὰ τρία.
