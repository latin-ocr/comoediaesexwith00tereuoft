‘ mihi3’ but in Lucretius we have one or
two instances of an undoubted accusa-
tive, as in

“Nec, mare quae impendent, vesco sale
saxa peresa
Quid quoque amittant in tempore cer-
nere possis.’'
(i. 326, 327.)

We may therefore safely keep the old text.

3. Neque quo modo me inde (κτένα-
ham] We may compare the use of ⁴ ex-
pedio.’ See Andria iii. 5. lo, ll :

Viden me consiliis tuis
Miserum impeditum esse? Da. At jam
expediam,”
where see note. Compare also Hecyra v.

 

 

Nescis, Parmeno,
Quantum hodie profueris mihi, et me ex
quanta aerumna extraxeris.”

Aster v. 4 most copies have the line:

“Quae si non astu providentur, me aut
herum pessum dabunt-¹ ¹

But this has evidently been transferred to
this place from Andria i. 3. 3, and does
not suit the present context, while it is
absent from some good manuscripts. 1
have therefore omitted it from the text.

6. Tum temporie mihi punctum] ¹ And
then 1 have only a moment to do this in, ‘for
my master is close at hand.’ Cicero often
uses the expression? ‘punctum temporis!
See examples in Forcellini. We have it in
the well-known lines-of Horace in a slightly
different form:

‘⁶ Sed vocat usque suum qua populus adsita
Liffiirtillius vicina refugit jurgia; tanquam

Sit proprium quicquam puncto quod mo-
bilis horae

Permut’et dominos et cedat in altera
Jura,

(Epist. ii. 2. 170-174,)

and in Lucretius, speaking of the light and
warmth of the sun:

’ἡ — Haec puncto canuntur lapsa
Pepgtum coeli spatium diffundere seee.”
(iv. 201, 2⁰2.)

For ‘ad hanc rem' see note on-Andri· i.

7. Quod quum audierit] ‘For when he
hears of this what palliative ean Ι find for
his anger? Should Ι spenk, 1 should eu·
rage him. Should Ι hold my tongue, 1
should goad him on. Should 1 excuse my-
self, it would be lost labour! ⁴ Quod' N
refers to the ‘ audacia* mentioned above.
The phrase ‘laterem lavem,’ ‘ 1 should be
washing a brick: is a translation of a Greek
proverb, πλίνθους πλύνειν, or πλίνθον
πλύνεις. We need not speculam very⁴
deeply, as some have done, on the origin of
the proverb, It would be a pretty hopeless
rask to wash a brick in the hopes of getting
the colour out of it.

9. Tum Antipho me excruciat animi]
After words expressing any affection of the
mind the Latin idiom employs a genitive
case of object. The true notion of the
genitive is to express the relation between
the subject and the predicate, and so we
often find this case employed where an
adjective would be equally correct, in such
phrases as ⁴ vis ignis,’ ¹ vis ignea! We have
the genitive after ⁴ studiosus,' ‘incertum’
‘dubius‚' ‘falsus,' ‘vagus,' ⁴ suspensus,' and
such verbs as ‘ desipere.’ ¹ falli‚’ and many
