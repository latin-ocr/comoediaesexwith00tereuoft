3. Sed quum tu satura atque ebria eris]
‘ But when you have had enough to eat and
to drink, see that the boy has enough food.'
‘ Satur ’ is a more general term than
⁴ ebrius.) See Adelphi y. l. 3 z ‘⁴ Sed post³

and in one place it has the notion of ‘ plen-
tifu1.’ See Casina iii. 6. 31 ε “ Facite coe-
nam mihi ut ebria sit.” Martial very fre-
quently applies ⁴ ebrius ' to dyed garments.
See Epigram. xiv. 154, on wool dyed the
colom· of an amethyst :

⁸⁴ Ebria Sidoniae quum sim de sanguine
conchae,
Non video quare sobria lana vocer.'’

5. Dejerat persancte] For ‘ dejerat’
see note on Eunuchus ii. 3. 39.

6. Neque has respicere Deos opinor]
⁴ Certainly these women do not fear the
gods, and I don't think that the gods pay
any attention to them! On the meaning
of ‘respicio ¹ see note on Andria iv. l. 17.
Donatus says, ‘⁶ Et inferiores sunt quam in
quas Dii vindicent;'' which is clearly the
true meaning. They do not sear the gods,
for the gods are sure not to notice their
. conduct. This is the idea which runs
through the ode addressed to Barine by
Horace (Carm. ii. 8), which commences

‘⁶ Ulla si juris tibi pejerati

Poena, Barine, nocuisset unquam 3

Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
Turpior ungui,

Crederem.”

The opposite idea is expressed by Plautus,
Persa iv. 4. 32—34 ε

“ Sa‘. Esne tu huic amicus? Io. Tanquam
Di omnes qui coelum colunt.

Do. Tum tu mihi es inimicus certum
nam generi lenonio

Nunquam ullus Deus tam benignus fuit
qui fuerit propitius.’'

[n the passage before us Phidippus means,
‘ Bacchis may perjure herself with impunity:
she fears no punishment.’ He is naturally

7. Ancillas dedo]
the testimony of slaves was not received
otherwise than by turture. An accused
person might offer his slaves, or demand
those of his adversary, to be examined by
torture. It was sometimes left to theac-
cuser to apply any kind of turture he
pleased. This offer and demand were called
πρόκλησις εἰς βάσανον. A refusal was ι
strong presumption of guilt. Tor-ture was
also applied to slaves under the Roman law.
See the Dictionary of Antiquities, article
⁴ Tormentum.’ So here Bacchis says, ‘ 1 give

tation that I shall have, of having been the
only one to do what other courtezans avoid
doing.' For ‘ poenitet ’ see Eunuchus v. 6.
12, and note.
