So. Quid agam Ρ quem mihi amioum inveniam misera P aut
quo consilia haec referam Ρ aut

ll . Quid tua, malum, id refert ?] This
line has been noticed in the note on
Hecyra iv. 3. ll, where the phrase ‘ tua re-
fert ’ is discussed. ‘ 'rua’ and other similar
words with ‘ refert’ have the last syllable long
in every case that Ι have noticed except in
this passage, where ⁴ tiia mallium' forms a
tribrach in the place of an iambus. Donatus
evidently had the existing order of the text,
and so have all the manuscripts. I have
therefore left it, and the more because it is
if genuine an important exception to the
common rule. The difficulty might be
evaded by reading Quid, malum, tua id
refert ?' which may after all be right. In
the following line I have adopted ⁶ facere,'
the reading of the Bembine MS.‚ with-
out however following Bentley in his
transposition of the remainder of the line,
which does not seem to be necessary.

14. Mulier mulieri mayis conyruil]
This is on the principle of ‘similia simili-
bus,’ κεραμεὺς κεραμεῖ. Α proverb is
quoted from Plutarch:

γέρων γέροντι γλῶτταν ἡδίστην ἔχει.
παῖς παιδὶ καὶ γυναικὶ πρόσφορον
γυνη. -

15.] Chremes, now that he has ar-
ranged Phormio’s business, and got rid of
Antipho's wife, hopes to bring about the
match which he had at heart between his

nephew and his' daughter. But he does
not know at present where to find them.

Ac'r V. ScENu Ι. As Chremes is about
to go in search of his daughter, Sophrona
her nurse appears, lamenting the mistor-
tunes which she fears are about to happen
to her mistress. ‘ I did my best,' she
says, ‘to provide for her by getting her
married, although 1 knew that the mar-
riage was not of any legal value. And all
this while 1 have been unable to discover
her father.’ Chremes now calls her, and
on her recognizing him explains that the
name of Stilpho, by which she addresses
him, was assumed only from his fear that
his wife would discover his eonnexions at
Lemnos. Sophrona then tells him that
Phanium had been married to Antipho,
and explains how the marriage was made
up. Chremes is delighted to find that the
very thing that he has set his heart on has
come to pass without any effort of his, but
he warns Sophrona not to let any one
know that Phanium is his daughter.
