with the addition of Ritschl’s conjecture
⁴ Quia! Bentley transposes the first two
words, ‘ Ille Cliua'1'‚’ but it has already
been observed in the note on Andria ii. 6.
8, that the form ‘ -a‘i ’ was obsolete in the
time of Terence. Bentley’s alteration also
introduces here the licence of ‘i'lle,' which
has been noticed in the same note. Al·
though Ritschl's emendation has no support
of manuscripts, yet it is sufficiently happy,
and his authority is so high upon any matter
connected with Plautus and Terence, that I
have thought it right to assign it a quasi
standing in the text. ⁴ Videlicet ’ holds the
same position in the line and sentence in
Adelphi iii. 4. 4. In all places in Terence it
is to be pronounced as if written ‘ vilicet,’
aster the analogy of ‘ ilicet‚' and ‘ scilicet.y

5. Idcirco huie nostro tradita eet pro-
*vincia]· Because that slave of Clinia' s is a
rather eluggi sh fellow‚ therefore the busi
neas has been handed over to this fellow of
θυι-93 ‘Provincia’ is often used as the
word ‘ province’ with us to signify ‘ duty'
ν or ‘business’ Among other passages we
may compare Phormio i. 2. 21 :

‘⁶ Abeuntes ambo hic tum senes me filiis
Relinquunt quasi magistrum. Da. O
Geta, rovinciam
Cepisti uram.’'
Plautus, Pseudolus i. 2. 16, where Ballio is
giving orders to her slaves:

“Atque heri ante dixeram omnibus dede-
ramque eas provincias ;''

and v. 25 t

“Tu qui urnam habes aquam vigere, face
plenum aenum sit cito, ἡ

Te cum securi caudicali praeficio provin· ’

Cla-e!

Cicero uses the word once or twice· ιιι the

„same sense, as in his Oration for Sulla, c.

poposcit,ut cum prima luce consulem saluta-
tum veniret, me in meo lectule trucidaret.''
‘Provincia ’ is derived by Festus from ‘ ·
vinco ;' by others more probably '1¹:2¹
⁴ providentia! See Long’s note on Cicero}
In Verrem ii. 2. 1.

7. Recte equidem] See notes on ii. 1.
15, and Eunuchus ii. 3. 50.

10. Aquilae senectus] A rather obscure
proverb originating in a theory about the
eagle⁷ that in old age it only drinks ς and so
applied to old men who drink more· than
they eat. It was also used more generally
to signify a vigorous old age. Authorffies
for both these applicatione are given in
Forcellini. There' is a Greek proverb ἀετοῦ
{gt‘zssh”3’5'533'15132'33ufl‘2'35 ‘²⁸³¹‘ ⁸ ⁸⁸⁰ ¹⁹

12. Sic sati⁸]‘ Pretty well! Compare
Phormio' 1. 2. 6ος note on Andria iv. ὅ. 9,
and in this play iii. l. 49.

15. Aridum] ‘ Dry ' or ‘ stingy.' The
idea is taken from a dry unfruitful soil
which yields nothing. So' in Plautus, Aulu-
laria ii. 4. 18: “Pumex non aeque· est
aridus atque hic est senex!

“ Illam sibi officiosam provinciam de-
