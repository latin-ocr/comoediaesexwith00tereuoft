‘ Sic

junctive is put where we should expect the
pluperfect. So in Virgil, Aen. viii. 643: “At
tu dictis, Albane, maneres.’' It is more
generally thus used when there is an idea
of repetition conveyed or of a continuanee
of action, as opposed to the completed ac-
tion of the pluperfect. (See Madvig's
Grammar, § 347.)

55. Ex animo] ⁴ Sincerely3’ ‘from the
bottom of your heart.’ Compare “Quod
tibi bene ex animo volo‚'’ Heaut. v. 2. 63
Adelphi v. 7. 21. So “ ex animo facere,'’
Adelphi i. l. 47, and the common phrase
‘⁴ ex tui animi sententia,” ‘ on your word of
honour! See note on Heaut. iv. 3. 5.

Αοτ IV. Scarus V. A new character is
now brought on the scene, Crito of Andros,
cousin to Chrysis. He had heard of her
death, and being her nearest kinsman, had
’ come to Athens to claim her property. He
is in fact the Deus ex machina of the play,
and the necessary hinge upon which the
λύσις of the plot turns. Like uncles in
modern comedy, he acts a liberal part and
does his best to make every one happy.

Metre3 iambic trimeter.

2. Sese] The pronoun is pleonastic. So
Eun. Prol. 1: “ Qui placere se studeat
bonis quam plurimis.’¹ ‘Divitias’ must
be pronounced ‘ditias.’ Heaut. i. 2. 203
iii. 2. 16. (See Introduction.)

3. Viveret] The common editions give
the reading ‘vivex-e! But we cannot say

‘optavit se pauper vivere! Bentley was

therefore right in substituting ⁴ viveret,' the
{egdigggggther MSS„ comparing Adelphi

 

et tu illum, si esses homo,
Sineres nunc facere, dum per aetatem licet,
Potius quam ubi te exspectatum ejecisset
Aligrliidre aetate post faceret tamen.’'

Compare also Tacitus, Ann. xiii. 42: ‘⁸ Cri-
men, periculum, omnia potius toleraturum
quam veterem ac domi partam dignationem
subitae felicitati submitteret.''

4. Rodien-unt] Her property went to
the next of kin in default of a testamentary
disposition. ‘ Redire ' was commonly used
in this case, ‘venire' whenssan inheritance
was left by will. So Hecyra i. 2. 97 ε “ Ea
ad hos redibat lege hereditas.” But in
Cicero, In Verr. ii. 1. 45, “ Minucius quidam
mortuus est—ejus testamentum erat nul-
lum. Lege hereditas ad gentem Minuciam
veniebat,’' ‘venire’ is used in the sense of
‘ redire.

8. Itan Chrysis? hem] ⁴ Is Chrysis
as 1 hear—Yes‚ we are undone by her
death. And as for ourselves we do the
best we can, as the proverb goes, since we
cannot do as we would.¹ ‘Satine recte?’
is a common formula. So “ satin’ salve ?’'
Eun. v. 5. 8, Livy i. 58, both cases there in
the various readings ‘ rectae ' and 'salvae’

9. Sic] A common expression, ⁴ so—
so! Compare Phormio i. 2. 94: “Da.
Quid paedagogus ille qui citharista-iam Ξ
