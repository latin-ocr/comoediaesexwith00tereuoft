seems in some cases to be merely capricious‚ yet in most instances these
changes are regulated by certain principles, and are made to accom-

, modate the metre to the character of the action which is being carried

on. Thus, to enumerate a sew cases,

1. Iambic trimeters are often used when the conversation becomes
less animated, or when a narrative follows an excited conversation, as in
Heaut. ii. 3, where we have at the beginning of the scene the arrival of
the servants, and the alarm of Clinia, given in trochaic tetrameters
catalectic (vv. 1—15) and iambic tetrameters (16-23). Then when
Syrus proceeds to quiet him by relating the real circumstances of his
mistress, we have iambic trimeters (24—70). He comes to the men-
tion of Bacchis, and then it is Clitipho's turn to be in alarm, all which
is described in trochaic tetrameters catalectic (71-98), and the scene
ends with iambic trimeters (99—139), in which Syrus endeavours to
persuade Clitipho into moderation and prudence. Many other examples
might be given of these artificial changes of metre. This is as good as
any that could be chosen, and it will be easy for the student to apply
this hint to every similar case in Terence.

2. The metre is often changed, as well as the nature of the dialogue,
either on the departure of one of the characters, as in Heaut. v. 2. 27,
Hecyra iv. 1. 51, Adelph. ii. 1. 433 iv. 5. 73, or on the arrival of a
new person, as in Heaut. ii. 4. 26, Phorm. ii. 1. 23, δια, a single verse

being sometimes inserted in this case to break the uniformity of the
scene.

3.. A change often takes place when some new incident is alluded to,
or on some sudden turn of the conversation, when the speaker wishes

to call particular attention to his words. See And. iii. 2. 17, 18.
Eun. iv. 6. 15, 8⁶0. Hec. ii. 9. 20. Phorm. i. 3. 25.

4. At the end of a scene, as in And. i. 5. 64, 653 iv. 1. 57, 58, Heaut.
v. 2. 48, 49, especially when the speaker intends to carry on his
audience to the remainder of the play by expressing some new deter-

mination that he has made, or by asking some question which leads to
a development of the plot.

. 5. At the beginning of a scene, as in Eun. v. 8. 1, Adelph. 111. 1. 1,
to express some change of feeling. This is commonly expressed in all
parts of the scene by a corresponding change of metre.

6. This change of verse is generally made so that there seems to be
