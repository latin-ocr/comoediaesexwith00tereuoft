HEAUTONTIMORUMENOS.

Tibi autem porro ut non sit suave vivere:
Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentia.

Quodcunque inciderit in mentem volet : neque id

Putabit, pravum siet an rectum quod petet.
Tu rem perire et ipsum non poteris pati.
Dare denegaris3 ibit ad illud ilico,

Quo maxime apud te se valere sentiet :

Abiturum se abs te esse ilico minabitur.

Me. Videre verum, atque ita uti res est, dicere.

Dum id quaero tibi qui fih'um restituerem.

Oh. Dic.

Id ut maturent facere : cupio illi dare

Quod vult z cupio jam videre.

Vicini nostri hic ambigunt de finibus :

Me cepere arbitrum: ibo ac dicam, ut dixeram

Juvenal applies the word to the boring of
the ears for earrings:

“Cur timeam dubitemve locum defendere
Νέῐιιιιέῗέιῗῑιιρὴταιεω, molles quod iu aure
fenestrae
Arguerint, licet ipse negem ?''
Sat. i. 103—105.

78. Dare deneqarie] ‘ Let us suppose
that you at last refuse to supply him! The
omission of ‘ si' may be compared with
virgil, Aen. vi. 30 ε

“ — Tu quoque magnam
Pafflelpgrtgpere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare,

The use of the second person in all tenses
of the subjunctive mood, has the effect of
making the sentence entirely hypothetical 3
and the further effect of the use of the
Futurum exactum is to mark the sup-
posed ca'se aa single and exceptional, occur-

friendship or of an agreement between two
parties, asin numerous passages. Tacitus
uses the word ‘ dextrae ’ alone in the sense
of ‘a treaty:' “A rege Parthorum Arta-
bano legati venere. Miserat amicitiam ac
foedus memoraturus, et cupere renovari
dextras‚” Annal. ii. 58.

88.] In the old copies the three lineswhich
stand at the end of this scene are placed
here immediately after the words ‘ operam
dabo! Bentley was the first to transfer
them to their present place, for reasons of
considerable weight. (1) Menedemus could
hardly remain on the stage if the words
‘ concede hinc domum ’ were placed before
line 89. (2) Syrus too plainly would have
been on the stage at the same time, without
taking any part, or being pereeived by Me-
nedemus. (3) The formula ‘a me neseio
quis exit ’ is commonly used by Terence in
concluding a scene. The whole
runs far more naturally with Beutley's
order, which has been adopted by many

ing once for all, See notes on Andria i. 3. g ood editors.

84. Cedo dextram] The ancients used

sometimes to give their hands as a form of
salutation, see Aristophanen, Clouds 81 :

ΣΤ. κύσον με καὶ τὴν χεῖρα δὸς τὴν
δεξιὰν, Δ

but more commonly it was as a pledge of

‘arbiter‚’ see note on Andria, Prolog. 24.
