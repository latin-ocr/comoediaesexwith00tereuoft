terpretamentis nascitur: scriptum est autem
uspiam ab eo qui paullo ante (v. 3 0 poeta
positum uspiam meminerit.” Prolego-
mena ad Plautum, p. 119.) Of Ritschl’s
emendations I have spoken generally in the
Introduction. In considering any particular
passage I would give the greatest weight to
his opinion where there appeared to be a
clear necessity for an alteration. The pas-
sage quoted from Plautus shows that the
phrase ‘ ceciderit uspiam ⁷ was used in this
connexion3 and the mere fact'of the occur-
rence of ⁴ uspiam ' a few lines before is not
sufficient to demand its rejection. ‘ Us-
piam ’ is for ‘ usque jam ' as ‘ quispiam ’ for
‘ quisque jam‚' and retains the local meaning
of ⁴ usque' (see note on Eunuchus iii. 2.
18). ⁴ Paro’ is here -used in the sense of
⁴ to adopt,' from its fundamental meaning
‘ to acquire.' It is often used for ‘buy-
ing,’ as in Eunuchus iii. 2. 35.

l 15.] Ritschl emends these lines as fol-
ows:

ἦ· Atqui ex me hic natus non est sed fratre
ex meo.

Dissimili is studio est.''
The emendation is ingenious, and gets rid
of the slight irregularity of the ordinary
line, where we are obliged to make ‘sed
ex ’ coalesee in pronunciation‚ and to
lengthen ‘is ' by ictus. But on the other
hand Ritschl’s reading drops the expressive
⁸ adeo‚' which is no doubt genuine; and 1
have therefore retained the ordinary text.
‘ Is ' becomes an emphatic word at the com-
mencement of the sentence, and may there-
fore fairly have the ictus, as many other
words have in similar positions. In v. 16
Bentley places a full stop aster ‘est' and
connects the following words with the next

sentence3 not with any advantage to rhythm
or sense. ⁴ My brother and 1‚' says Micio,
⁸ have been of a different turn from our early
manhood. I have followed this easy city
life and its repose. He has taken the oppo-
site line.' For the idea of ‘ clemens’ see

notelae 036Andria i. 1. 9, and Plautus, Stichus
ιν. . :

“ Hodiene exoneramus navem, frater ἓ Pa.
Clementer volo.

Nosmet potius nos vicissatim oneremus
voluptatibus.”

18. Et, quod fortunatum isti putant]
‘ And although you will find others consi-
der it the greatest blessing, 1 have never
married.' ‘ Isti ¹ of course refers to those
who disagree with his opinion; though in
some editions it is badly explained other-
wise. The following lines of Menander are
preserved by commentators:

Ὦ μακάριόν με. οὐ γυναῖκα λαμβάνω,

which is commonly written wrongly γυ-
ναῖκα οὐ λαμβάνω, 01111 again:

ὅστις γενόμενος βούλεται ζῆν ἡδέως
ἑτέρῳν γαμούντων αὐτὸς ἀπεχέσθω
γαμων,

01111,

τὸ γυναῖκ’ ἔχειν, εἶναι τε παίδων, ὦ φίλε,
πατέρα, μερίμνας τῷ βίῳ πολλὰς φέρει.

22. Inde] ‘ Of these 1 have adopted the
eldest as my own.’ ‘ Inde ’ is here resolved
into the corresponding ‘ ex iis,' as we have .
seen with ‘ibi ’ and ‘ ubi ¹ (notes on Heaut.
iii. 1. 61, and iv. 6. 9). Compare ‘ unde’
for ⁴ 0 quibus ' Eunuchus i. 2. 34, and note.
