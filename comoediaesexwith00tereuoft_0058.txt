To the name head may be referred all the common instances of shortened
words, usually called by grammarians cases of Apocope. These, like all
other such words, were shortened in common conversation on exactly
the same principle as ‘nempe‚’ ⁴ unde,’ (ξι-,0. Nostin, viden, cyon, tan, &a

verbs, &c.‚ though most frequently, perhaps, with the passive participle.
In many- places in Terence this contraction has led to the omission of
‘ es.’ See note on Andria iii. 5. 15.

The preceding inquiry has embraced the greater number of the verbal
peculiarities of Terence connected with the pronunciation of words. In
a matter of this extent I cannot pretend to have exhausted the list of
words which fall under the heads above stated. All I can hope to have
done is to have indicated to the student the true laws of Terentian pro-
nunciation3 and I have purposely dwelt at some length upon the details
of this subject, because we find in the ordinary editions of Terence to
which the English student has access, and even in books of abetter
class, a great confusion between the system of metrical quantity as fol-
lowed in the Greek dramatists, ‘and the laws of Roman pronunciation,
which we should expect to find exemplified in the works of Terence and

Plautus. Many writers speak of Terence's ‘ Oomic Licences‚’ as if in ’

language, as well as in the treatment of their subjects, poets might
