INTRODUCTION.

ἃ 'sn Andria derives its name from Glycerium, the heroine of the play3

who was from Andros. Upon her previous history turns the deuoue-
ᾗ ment of the plot. Chremes and Phania were brothers, two Athenian

citizens. On occasion of a voyage to Asia Chremes had left his only

;« daughter Pasibula with Phania, who shortly afterwards followed his
1 >j brother to Asia to escape from a war that was raging in Greece. He
{ss ἶ was overtaken by a storm, and shipwrecked, together with Pasibula,
upon the island Andros. He there attached himself as a client to a
citizen, who entertained him liberally, and upon his death, which

occurred shortly after, adopted Pasibula and brought her up with his

¹ Η own daughter Chrysis, having changed her name to Glycerium. 1 Chrysis

loss of Pasibula, and is very anxious that she should be well married to ’
1,.Ῠ1ῑ such an excellent young man as Pamphilus, who, happily, while enjoy-

’·,1 tion of every one. So Philumena and Pamphilus are betrothed by their
-,11-’1 parents, entirely without the knowledge of the bridegroom elect. All

f„ Pamphilus shows something more than an ordinary solicitude for a

. ΐ, young woman whom Simo ascertains to be the sister of Chrysis. The
