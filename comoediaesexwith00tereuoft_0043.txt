INTRODUGTION. xxxvii

“ Student facere: in apparando consumi'mt diem.’'
(Adelph. v. 7. 2.)

In the class of words noticed above in which ‘ v ’ was the distinguish-

· ing letter we found that in contraction the semivowel passed into its
¹ vowel sound, as cave = cau. In the present instance ‘ u ’ has often the
,- fo‘rce of ‘ w,’ as duo = dwo, or voluerit z volaverit, while in other cases,
ξ as in that of studet, the consonant disappears‚ and the ‘ u ' sound is

s retained.

‘j ‘·year,' which are scarcely to be distinguished in the ordinary pronun-
j, ciation. The following instances may be noticed of the different cases

and genders of ‘ idem :'
