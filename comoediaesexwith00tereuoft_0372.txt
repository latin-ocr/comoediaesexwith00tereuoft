MICIO.

Mi. Ita uti dixi, Sostrata,

AESCHINUS.

Mi. Aeschine.
Aes. Quid huic hic negoti est Ρ Mi. Tune has pepulisti

Tege? ‘Cur non ludo hunc aliquantisper? Melius est, 5

Quandoquidem 1100 nunquam 1111111 ipse voluit credere.
Nihil mihi respondes Ρ Aes. Non equidem istas quod sciam.
Mi. Ita Ρ nam mirabar quid hic negoti esset tibi.

Erubuit : salva res est.
Tibi vero quid istic est rei?

Aes. Dic sodes, pater,

Mi. Nihil mihi quidem: 10

Amicus quidam me a foro abduxit modo

Huc advocatum sibi.

Aes. Quid Ρ

Mi. Ego dicam tibi:

Habitant 1110 quaedam mulieres pauperculae,

‘Open the door some one immediately!
⁴ Aliquis ' is used here distributively, and
thus takes the construction of a noun of
number. Compare Plautus, Menaechmei

iv. 2. 115:

² ‘⁴ -—- Heus ecquis hic 00130111-
Aptgiiite, atque Erotium aliquis evocate
ante ostium.''

In Eunuchus, Prol. 1, we have ‘ quisquam ’
similarly used of the plural number. We
may compare the use of τις 111 Sophocles,
Ajax 964·

οἱ γὰρ κακοὶ γνώμαισι τάγαθὸν χεροῖν
ἔχοντες οὐκ ἲσασιπ πρίν τις ἐκβάλῃ.

return for his concealment of his love
affair. ‘ Ι 11070 just been in here,' he says,
⁸ 00 0 witness for a friend of mine who has
some business with the women that live
here. It appears that the young woman
has lost her father, and my friend, being
her nearest relation, is about to marry her
as the law directs3 and has now come for
that purpose 10 take her with him to Mile-

tus. Her mother, itis true, has got upa
story that she has 0 child by some 0110
0100; 11111 that cannot be admitted as 011
excuse, and she will 11070 to go! This
throws Aeschinus into great alarm, and
he begins 10 tell his adopted father the
whole story; but he informs him that he
knows all already, and reads him 0 gentle
lecture upon his folly in concealing 1110
affair from him, and the remissness with
which he had behaved throughout, finish-
ing by telling him to go and fetch his wife
home at once. As for the gentleman from
Miletus, he should hear no more of him.
The scene ends, as is natural, with strong
protestations on Aeschinus' part of affection
for Micio.

The Metre is as follows: 77. 2, 3. 45-—
