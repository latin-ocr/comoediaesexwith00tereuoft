C'h. Profecto quanto magis magisque cogito,

Nimirum dabit haec Thais mihi magnum malum:

Ita me video ab ea astute labefactarier‚

J am tum cum primum jussit me ad se arcessier.

Roget quis “ Quid tibi cum illa Ρ ” ne noram quidem3 5
Ubi veni, causam ut ibi manerem repperit.

Ait rem divinam fecisse, et rem seriam

Velle agere mecum. J am tum erat suspicio

Dolo malo haec fieri omnia : ipsa accumbere

Aer III. Scmm ΙΙΙ. Chremes arrives
full of perplexity at his summons to
Thais. He cannot understand what she
wants with him, and certainly does not know
what he has to do with her. Her conduct
to him had been so marked, and the ques-
tions which she had put were so unintelli-
gible to him that he can only suspect that
she means mischief. For what has she got
to do with Sunium or his little sister who
died long ago ? Perhaps she wishes to
pass herself off to him as this sister. But
that won’t do, she is too old. So he is in a
state of perplexity, when Pythias comes up
and explains that he is to join Thais at
Thraso's house, where he goes with one of
her maids. Donatus remarks that Chremes
in Menander is intended to be an unpo-
lished rustic, unacquainted with the man-
ners and language of the town. Hence a
certain want of connexion in his language.
But this after all is not much. The whole
scene is rather otiose, and evidently in-
tended merely to fill a gap, and suggest the
course of the p.lot

The Meti-ep is iambic trimeter.

7. Ait rem divinamsecisee]‘ She said she
had been attending a sacrifice, and wished
to talk on matters of importance with me!

Donatus gives two explanatione of these
words: (l) Thais seemed to wish to keep
him with her, and so delayed her business
on the pretext that she had just been en-
gaged in religious duties and could not enter
on it at present. (2) That having this
matter of importance to talk over with
Chremes, she had commenced by a saeri-
fiee sor good luck' s sake. Τὴε first seems
to harmonize best with the preceding line.
Probably the meaning is, that at his first
visit Thais had kept him waiting a long
time, and made this apology. A sacrifice
seems to have been a standing engagement
with ladies when they wanted an excuse for
their absence. See Hecyra i. 2. 1⁰9.

9. Dolo malo] See note on Andria i. 1.
119. The use of the words here exactly cor-
responds to the technical sense of ‘dolus
malus ' among Roman jurists. Cicero (De
had been taken in about the purchase of a
fish-pond at Syracuse, says, that after all he
had no remedy: ‘⁴ Nondum enim Aquillius,
collega et familiaris meus protulerat de Dolo
Malo formulas. In quibus ipsis cum ex eo
quaereretur, quid esset dolus malus, respon-
debat, cum esset alind simulatuin aliud
actum. ''
