75. Fructum] ‘The produce which my
wife’s Lemnian farms yield.' ‘ Fructus ’
meant originally the increase of the ground.
It is then applied to produce in general,
whether of land, mines, or the interest of
money. Here it means the yearly rental of
his wife’s land. ‘ Praedium’ originally meant
property which was made a security to the
state by a ⁴ praes! Subsequently the word
was limited to signify land generally (Dic-
tionary of Antiquities, sub voc.). Many
instructive passages are referred to by For-
cellini.

Ac'r IV. Scana IV. Antipho now takes
Geta to task for his extraordinary conduct.
⁴ You have ruined me‚' he says ς ⁴ why need

{3¹12 {ifi‘nssssviaffssssfflffl hffryhffiee} {33¹5
suppose you wish me to believe that he will
not, and will refuse to pay the money, and
so quietly submit for our sakes to be put
into jail! Geta shows him that there is
another side to the question. Phormio will
take the money ; but between that and his
marriage some little time must elapse;

meanwhile he will get the money from
Phaedria and repay it. If you want to
know how he will get off the marriage,
why he will find a hundred excuses. So
you may set your mind at rest, and go and
tell Phaedria that he shall have the money.

The Metre is iambic trimeter. ,

1. Emunxi arqento· eene-⁹] ‘ 1 have
cheated the old men of their money.
‘Emungo’ occurs in this sense not un-
freqnently in comic writers. See Long' s
note on the passage of Caecilius quoted by

Hem, si quid velis,

Cicero, De Amicitia 26, where he explains
the word, “To wipe a man's nose for him
implies that he is a driveller and cannot do
it for himself 3 and hence it means to outwit
and cheat him.'’ See the well-known lines
of Horace:

‘⁴ Nec sic enitar tragico differre colori
Ut nihil intersit Davusne loquatur et
Pyffiissx emuncto lucrata Simone talentum,
An custos famulusque Dei Silenus
alumni.” (Ars Poetica 236—239.)

See Macleane’s note on ‘emunctae naris:
Sat. i. 4. 8.

2. Satin est id ?] Antipho means, ‘ And
is that all you ought to care about?
Ought not you to take care how you get
the money ?’ Geta pretends to understand
him, ¹ Is the money that you have got suffi-
cient ?’ and so he answers, ⁸ It is all that I
was told to get! For ‘ tantum' see note ou
Eunuchus v. 5. 26.

5. Ad restim] ‘You have brought my
affairs into such a state, that 1 may as well
go and hang myself at once) This prover-
bial phrase, ‘ad restim res reditss ‘affairs
are utterly desperateff occurs only here, and
in a fragment of Caecilius, quoted from
Nonius 111. 64· .

“Ad restim res redit3 imo collus, 11011
res ; nam ille argentum habet.'' κ

So’ αγχόνη is used. See Soph. Oed. Tyr.

Hei-‚acl 246. τόδ’ ἀγχόνης πέλας.

chus ν. 4. 24.
