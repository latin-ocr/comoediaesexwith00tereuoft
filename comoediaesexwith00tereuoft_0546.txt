‘is it at all strange, or any novelty, to be
called back when you have set off running ?’
The allusion is to the common practical
joke of calling after slaves who were in a
hurry. The same thing occurs a hundred
times in Plautus. See above, i. 4. 18,
note.

9. Peryit hercle] Bentley re-writes this
line; but we need not enter into his emen-
dations. Some read ‘pergin hercle?' on
the authority of a single manuscript. But
the text is very good as it stands. Geta
says, when he hears himself called again,
⁸ The fellow is still going on ;' and then
addressing his persecutor, ⁴ You shall never
beat me,' he says, ‘by your boring.’ For
⁸ odio ’ see note on Hecyra i. 2. 48.

210. Vapula] ‘Go andbeflogged.’ This,
as Festus informs us, was a common answer
when one wished to express utter indiffer-
enee. Compare Plautus, Asinaria ii. 4.

71-732

“Le. Pergin precari pessimo? Me. Quae
res ? tun libero homini
Male servus loquere? Le. Vapula. Me.
Id quidem tibi hercle fiet,
Ut vapules Demaenetum simul ac con-
spexero hodie.”

The proverb ‘ vapula Papiria ’ was common
in the same sense aeeording to Festus 3 and
arose from the supposed speech of a newly
freed female slave to her mistress, when she

should have saluted her res y, in an-
swer to her mistress's salutation. The fol-
lowing fragment is given from the ‘Foene-
ratrix ' of Plautusz

“ Heus tu, in Barbaria quod dixisse dicitur
Liberta suae patronae id ego dico tibia
Liberta salve! vapula Papiria.”

13. Quantum eet qm· vivunt] See note
on Heaut. iv. 6. 6.

14. Ab Dis solue diliqere] This is sim-
ply a strong congratulatory expression, as
perhaps in Andria v. 6. 9. See note on that
passage.

16. Satin est εἰ te delibutum qaudio
reddo f] ⁴ Will you be> oontented if I
steep you with joy ? ' ⁴ Delibutus ' literally ·
means ⁴ smeared with oil,’ or any other unc-
tuous substance, and is so used by Cicero and
other writers. Apuleius, Metam. iii. (quoted
by Forcellini) has ⁴ delibutus laetitia,' pro-
bably an imitation of this passage of Τ6-
rence.

17. Quin tu . . . auser] ‘ Away with
your promises, and let us know what news
you are bringing? For ¹ aufer' see note 011
Phormio i. 4. 45, and for ⁴ quin ’ expuam-
latory, see note on Andria ii. 3. 25.

19. Recta domum sumus profecti] Bent-
ley proposes ‘recta ad Chremem,’ because
Demipho went straight to Nausistrata from
the forum (v. 2. ll, and v. 3. 7). He goes
on to say, “ Si recta domum ibant, quem
