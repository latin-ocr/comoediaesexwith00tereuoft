xxii INTRODUOTION.

Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, quum illis placet

Qui vobis universis et populo placent‚” διο.
(Adelphi, Prolog. 15—19.)

In both of these passages he evidently waives the question3 leaving the
decision of it in the first case to the judgment of his hearers, and in the
second case intimating that, even if it were true, it was a matter of
which he ought to feel proud rather than ashamed. Terence was evi-⁸ “
dently too good a courtier to deny fiatly an imputation which was to
the credit of his literary friends. They were uo doubt flattered by the
supposition of their having a. share in the compositions of Terence, and
he did not care to vindicate his own originality at the expense even of
their vanity. A compliment of this kind would eost him nothing, and
would be very acceptable to them. Nor perhaps did he consider Lavi-
nius entitled to any explanation on such a point ; and so he declined to
admit or to deny the charge which had been brought against him. On
every ground, then, we may reject this story which gives to Laelius or
Africanus the credit of the authorship of the best parts of the comedies
of Terence. His plays are so even and consistent throughout, indi-
vidually and with one another, that we might well defy any critic to
show where Terence left off and his friends began. Throughout his
plays there is the same neatness of language, the same attention to

metre, the same quiet tone of good-natured humour and practica] know· ’

ledge of the world. This must have proceeded from one and=the same ²
author, and that author none other than Terence himself. ι

The last accusation which Terence notices is that his plays were
deficient in strength, “tenui oratione et scriptura levi” (Phorm.
Prolog. 5); the complaint made in the famous epigram ascribed to·
Caesar, which sums up so accurately the judgment of antiquit-y that it
may be appropriately quoted here :—

“ Tu quoque tu in summis, O dimidiate Menander,
Funeris, et merito, puri sermonis amator,
Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis
Oomioa, ut aequato virtus polleret honore
Cum Graecis, neque in hac despectus parte jaceres.
Unum hoc maceror, et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.'’
