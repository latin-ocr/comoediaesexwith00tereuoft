AOTUS TERTII SOENA QUARTA.

ANTIPHO.

Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus in Piraeeo,

In hunc diem ut de symbolis essemus. Chaeream ei rei
Praefecimus3 dati annuli3 locus, tempus constitutum est.
Praeteriit tempus 3 quo in loco dictum est parati nihil est.
Homo ipse nusquam est ; neque scio quid dicam aut' quid

conj ectem.

N unc mihi hoc negoti caeteri dedere ut illum quaeram ;

quue adeo visam, si domi est.
Is est, an non est‘? ipsus est.

ornatus est P

‘ 1 beg of you just to step across where she
is now.' ‘Amabo‚' like ‘quaeso‚' is ordi-
narily used parenthetically, as a mere inter-
jection; but sometimes {t passes into the
sense of ‘ quaeso‚' or ⁴ amanter rogo,’ and
then it is found in construction with ‘ut'
and the conjunctive. Compare Plautus,
Menaechmei ii. 3. 76: “ Sed scin quid te
amabo ut facias ?'’ and iii. 3. 1 ι

“ Menaechme amare ait te multum Erotium
Ut hoc nunc una opera ad aurificem feras.’'

See also Cistellaria i. l. 105:

“ Nunc ego ted amabo ut hanc hoc triduum
solum sinas
Esse hic et servare apud me.''

Aer 111. ScaNa· IV. While Chaerea
has been carrying on his campaign under
the assumed character of Dorus, his friends
have been waiting for their dinner, which
was ω come off in the Piraeeus before now.
So Antipho comes to look for him, and
sees some one coming out of Thais' house
in a strange attire, whom he has the curi-
osity‘ to wait for.

The Metre is iambic tetrameter catalectic.

1. Heri . . . in Piraeeo] Cicero in one of
his letters to Atticus (vii. 3) quotes this
line as a precedent for his use of a preposi-
tion before the word ⁴ Piraeeum: which he
justifies by saying that he used the word as
the name of a district rather than a town,
and by the authority of Terence. He read
⁴ in Piraeeum.' But the reading of the text
is maintained by all existing manuscripts
and copies. The young men were quartered
at Piraeeus, so that ⁴ in Piraeeo ' would be
the only accurate phrase. Bentley quotes
two passages from Plautus, where the pre-

Quisnam hic a Thaide exit Ρ ’
Quid hoc hominis? qui hic

position ¹ in ' is used before ‘ Piraeeum ⁹
(Bacchid. ii. 3. 1 3 Mostell. i. l. 63).

2. In hunc diem nt de symbolis essemus]
⁴ To club together for a supper for to-day.'
See note on Andria i. l. 62.

Chaeream ei rei Praej'ecimus] ‘We made
Chaerea our steward ; our rings were au
given3 time and place appointed! Donatus
explains ‘praefecimus‚’ “ Id est, συμποσίαρ-
χον fecimus.’' In this passage the mean-
ing seems rather to be that Chaerea was to
make all necessary preparatione for the
feast. The συμποσίαρχος, or ⁸ magisterbi-
bendi,’ would be elected by the dice at the
time of the supper. In Plautus, Curculio
iv. l. 13, we meet with a phrase which it is
difficult to explain: ‘⁶ Symbolarum colla-
tores ad forum piscarium.'’ Forcellini ex-
plains it ⁴ contributors ' of alab-money:

and probably it is a mere abstract exprae- ⁸

sion to signify the parties of young men
who would stroll into the fish-market to
select a fine sturgeon or mullet for their
evening festivities. Rings and other valu-
ables were often given in pledge for money
on these occasions.

4. Parati nihil est] This form of the
genitive is common in Terence, aa ‘ol-nati,
tumulti‚’ in Andria ii. 2. 28, and above, ii.
2. 6: “ Quid istuc, inquam, ornati est ?”
⁴⁴ Quaesti‚'’ Hecyra v. 1. 9. Forcellini cou-
siders ‘ parati ’ to be from ‘ paratum ’ (⁸ Pa-
ratus’) 3 but if so, this is the only instanoe;

and Terence’s custom supporta the other

View.

8. Quid Izoc hominia ?] ‘What sort of
man is this? what sort of dress ?’ Com-
pare v. 1. 17: “Quid illuc hominis est ?”
Heaut. iv. 8. 7 : “ Quaeso quid tu hominis

es ?'’ Hecyra iv. 4. 21 :
