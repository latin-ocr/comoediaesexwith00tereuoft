AOTUS SECUNDI SOENA TERTIA.

SOSTRATA.

Aedepol nae nos sumus inique aeque omnes invisae viris, ..
Propter paucas, quae omnes faciunt dignae ut videamur malo.
N am, ita me Di ament, quod me accusat nunc vir sum extra

noxiam.

Sed non facile est expurgatu ; ita animum induxerunt socrus
- Omnes esse iniquas: haud pol me quidem ;λ nam nunquam

Habui illam ac si ex me esset nata: neo qui hoc mihi eveniat

Nisi pol filium multimodis jam exspecto -ut redeat domum.

for which I must go over to the forum!
‘ Quod' is frequently used in this manner
in Terence. Compare Heaut. Prol. 3:
“ Id primum dicam ε deinde quod veni elo-
quar.” See the Index of phrases. Com-
pare Plautus, Epidicus iii. 4. 24:

“Animum adverte, ut quod ego ad te venio
intelligas.’'

Stichus i. 2. 70:

‘⁶ Sed hoc est quod ad vos venio, quodque
esse ambas conventas volo.¹'

Aer II. Scan ΙΙΙ. Sostrata is left be-
hind on the stage; and breaks out into a
complaint on the subject of her grievance.
She is unjustly accused; and yet it is not
easy to clear herself. Her husband is full
of the idea that all mothers-in- law hate their
daughters-in·-law; which issar from being
the case with her. She can only hope that
her son will come home soon, and all will
be cleared up.

The Metre is trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectio.

2.] Euripides has some lines, from which
Apollodorus is supposed by some commen-
tators to have borrowed the idea of this
line; at all events they are very similar:

τὰ γὰρ γυναικῶν δυσχερῆ πρὸς ἄρσένσς,

κάν ταῖς κακαῖσιν ἁγαθᾳὶ, μεμιγμέναι
μισούμεθ’· οὕτω δυστυχεῖς πεφύκαμεν.

Ion 398 —400.

The words ⁴ dignae ut videamur malo ' must
be translated, ⁴ These few make us all seem
capable of wrong.’ ‘Dignus ’ means not
only ‘ worthy of receiving,’ as ‘ dignus ho-
nore‚' but also ‘fit to be classed with: as
‘ dignus majoribus 3' and so here ⁴ worthy of
being associated with what is bad!

4. Sed non facile est expurqatu] See
note on Heaut. ii. 3. 116.

5. Haud pol me quidem] We should
naturally have expected ‘ Haud pol ego
quidem ;’ for she speaks in her own person.
But in answers and additional statements it
is not uncommon for the latter clause to be
attracted into the oratio obliqua. Com-
pare Cicero, De Finibus ii. 27 : “ Qui autem
voluptate vitam effici beatam putabit, qui
sibi conveniet, si negabit voluptatem cres-
cere longinquitate? Igitur ue dolorem
quidem.’' De Natura Deorum i. 82: ‘⁶ Quid
igitur censes? Apin illum nonne deum vi.
deri Aegyptiis? Tam hercle quam tibi illam
vostram Sospitam.'' The same attaeaetion is
common in the second member of a com-
parison. See note on Adelphi iv. 1. 18.

7. Nisi] See notes on Andria iv. 1. 40,
and Heaut. v. 2. 4. Bentley would read
‘ expeto ’ for ‘ expecto ;’ but the change is
unnecessary.
