tipho, our young master, Demipho’s son,
and Phaedria his cousin, son of Chremes.
Well, that was a pretty charge, and I began
by doing my duty to my old master. 1
only got thrashed for that, so I changed my
tactics, and humoured the young meniu
every possible way. Well, there was a
young girl belonging to a slave merchant,
and Phaedria fell in love with her. He
used to escort her to and from school, and
was bent on getting her from her master.
Meanwhile Antipho had fallen in love with
a girl named Phanium, and wanted to
marry her. But he did not know how he
was to do it; for she had not afarthing,
and his father would be sure not to give his
consent, so he betook himself to one Phor-
mio, a parasite, who devised the following
plan. Phormio was to bring an action
against Antipho as her nearest relation, on
whom devolved the duty of marrying her;
and he was to win the suit. This plan was
actually carried out ; Antipho lost the suit,
and married the girl. And now,⁷ says Geta,
“the reckoning is to come. Whatever hap-
pens 1 depend on myself. As for Phaedria,
his affair is at a standstill, for he has no
means of purchasing the girl from her mas-
ter. His father is not come home yet.
My master is expected every moment. Both
the young men are at their wits' end, Phae-
dria in despair of ever getting his sweet-
heart, while Antipho is afraid that his wife
will be taken from him the moment his
father comes home!
