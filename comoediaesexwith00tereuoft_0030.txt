or hardly permitted enjoyment of churchmen and monks) has been
kept up in one of our great public schools3 and who ever heard such
passages as the description of the funeral 111 1116 ‘Andria,’ with the
orphaned girl throwing herself back on her lover’s bosom, ‘ flens quam
familiariter !’ The Davus and the Geta, the Gnatho, and the Thraso,
and the Phormio, are the types and parents of the fiatterers, and
Graciosos and Scapins, which have shaken the European scene with
laughter for centuries3 and themselves are but the antitypes and, it
was generally allowed, degenerate offspring of Menander and his school.
As an illustration of that Comedy, which, without ceasing to 116 6011116,
almost melts into the pathetic, read the first act of ‘Heautonti-
morumenos’ (a play not of the four usually acted at westminster),—
the poor father sternly punishing himself for what he considers his
unnatural harshness to his son, and refrain, if you can, at once ¹from
the quiet smile, and almost from the tear ³.”

Terence, in common with his friends and enemies, with Caecilius and
Lavinius (compare the Second Prolog. to the Hecyra with Phormi0‚
Prolog. 9, 10), owed much of his success in the first instance to the
excellence of 1118 managers‚ especially of Ambivius‚ who claims the chief
credit of the ultimate success of the plays of Caecilius, and apparently
did Terence the same service in the case of the ‘Hecyra.' These
managers had a direct interest in the plays which they represented (see
note on Hecyra, Second Prolog. 49), and would use their greatest efforts
to make them attractive. They had no doubt difficulties of the same kind
to struggle with as managers of theatres have been liable to from the
days of Thespis. Every change in the popular humour had to be
³ watched‚ met, and, if necessary, battled against and conquered. The
“glory of the boxers‚” the “suspense of the rope-dancer‚” the rush of
crowds from the country, and, above all the rest, a “rumour flying
round that a show of gladiators was going to be given‚’' must have
driven many and many a good play besides the ‘ Hecyra’ from the rude
boards of the Roman amphitheatre. These things were to Ambivius‚
Atilius, and Minuthius, what the whale and giant were to Molibre,
as rivals of his ‘L'Etourdi’ and ‘ Depit Amoreux ⁴,’ and what the Ο. P.

remarks on Plautus and Terence iu his work on Dramatic Art and Literature, Lectum
