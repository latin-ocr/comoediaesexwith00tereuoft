246 INTRODUCTION TO ADELPHI.

brother Ctesipho who had been brought up strictly at home in the
country! Micio in return justifies his mode of education. Meanwhile
Aeschinus is busied, with the assistance of his slave Parmeno, in
arranging matters with Sannio, who blusters loudly at first, but finds
at last that the best plan is to pocket his affront and trust to the young
men to pay him, for he will lose more by waiting to prosecute the
affair, as he is on the eve of a voyage to Cyprus, than if he abandons
the slave altogether. The news of Aeschinus' prank had spread over the
city, and it was now carried to Sostrata his destined mother-in-law by
Geta her slave, who had witnessed the whole affair. Sostrata sends her
trusty Geta to Hegio, an old friend of her late husband Simulus, who
will stand by her, and see that her daughter has justice done her.
Demea in the mean time is in consternation, for he has heard that
Ctesipho was with Aeschinus when this music girl was carried off ; but
Syrus, one of Micio's slaves, contrives, with great skill, to make the fact
,increase his good opinion of his son; for he represents Ctesipho to have
taken part in the affair only to blame his brother's dissolute conduct,
and says that as soon as the matter was over he had returned to the
country to his usual work. Demea is greatly affected to find that he
has one son who is a credit to his family, and sets off for his farm. On
his way he meets Hegio, from whom he learns the circumstances of
Aeschinus' connexion with Pamphila3 and at the same time he finds
from one of his farm servants that Ctesipho has never been to the farm
at all, as Syrus had pretended. These news send him back to Micio in a
rage3 but he is again met with a new fiction by Syrus, who revenges
himself on him by sending him on a fool's errand over the whole town
to look for his brother. Micio meanwhile has been with Hegio to
Sostrata and Pamphila, and has comforted them by giving 1118 consent
to the marriage of the young lady and Aeschinus. Demea now returns
from his fruitless search after his brother, and there is a general dis-
turbance, particularly when one of the slaves accidentally betrays the
,fact of Ctesipho’s being in Micio's house, where his father finds him with
the music girl. After some more discussions between Demea and Mici0,
the former suddenly determines to change his demeanour3 and to the
surprise of every one whom he meets, and not a little to his own, he
acts the courteous and complaisant man. He falls in with all their
humours, and promotes the happiness of all parties. Pamphila is
married to Aeschinu83 Sannio 18 paid3 Micio 18 made to marry Sostrata

Hegio 18 provided for3 and Syrus and his wife are freed m consideration
*of the great services which the cunning slave had rendered to morality.
The play concludes with a speech in which Demea explains the meaning
of his late conduct, and gives his hearers a little wholesome advice for

’ the future.
