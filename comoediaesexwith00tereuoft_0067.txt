INTRODUGTION. lxi

'Phe prevailing usage was to terminate each metre with a word. For

j the sake of variety this rule is frequently departed from with this pro-

vision, that when a word is divided between two metres, the accented
s syllable falls in the latter of the two, as

“ Misera? nam audilvisse vocem Ι pueri visus est Ι vagientis?
(Hec. iv. 1. 2.)

“Thais ego jamldfidum hic adsum. O Ι mi Chremes te ipsum Ι
expectabam.'' ¹ (Eun. iv. 6. 5.)

, III. Tnoomuo Dnmrmz Ounnono. This verse is nothing more
’ς e than the latter half of a trochaic Septenarius (ss υ - u Ι -ι u -).

It is sometimes used by Terence as one of the forms of the clausulae,

-s or shorter verses mixed with others of the same kind, and generally
ζ capable of being read as a continuation of the metre. These clausulae
, are either iambic or trochaio. Of the trochaic the following are ex-

's am les:
Η P “ Quid ais quum intel}lexeras.'’ (And. iii. 2. 37.)
“ Quicum loquitur Ι filius ?” (Heaut. i. 2. 4.)
“ Quod si abesset Ι longius.’' (Adelph. iv. 1. 8.)
’ “ Unde mihi auxili Ι sun petam ἒ” (Phorm. v. 1. 2.)
“ Ego istam invitis Ι 6mnibus.” (Adelph. ii. 1. 4.)
“ Dicam, non aedelpdl scio.” (Hec. iv. 1. 5.)

“ Proh Deum atque homin Ι tim fidem.‘’ (And. i. 5. 10.)

¹ IV. 'l'noonnc Mononmnn cinamomo, equivalent to the final seg-
ment of the trochaic septenarius (ss u -). It occurs sometimes in

exclamatione, as in Eun. ii. 3. 1: “ Occidi.'’

V. Tnocmc Monomma Auruncum as (ss u ,- υ).

“Dorio audi.'’ (Phorm. iii. 2. 1.)

II. Immo anns.

An iambic measure, as has been shown above (p. lix), differs from

trochaic in being preceded by an ‘anam-uris (υ Ι -ν υ -). Accordingly
ἑ {³ iambio verse is by some critics treated as derived from trochaic by th'e
' '- addition οἱ· an unaccented syllable at the commencement of the verse.
ἲ Bentley in his Σχιδίασμα arranges an iambic trimeter thus:
