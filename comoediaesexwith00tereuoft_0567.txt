 

TERENOE ΛΝΒ THE N EW OOMEDY. 493

Eun. i. l. 31:

‘⁸ -— Ne te afflictes. Pla. Itane suades Ρ Ρα. Si sapis:
Neque praeterquam quas ipse amor molestias
Habet addas, et illas quas habet recte feras.''

This passage seems undoubtedly to be a close imitation of
Μὴ θεομάχει, μηδὲ προσάγω *ᾧ πράγματι
χειμῶνας ἑτέρους, τοὺς δ’ ἀναγκαίους φέρι.
(Εὕν. Fragm. ii.)
Eun. iv. 4. 22:

‘⁴ Hic est vetus, rietus, veternosus senex,
Colore mustelino.'’

Here we are informed by Donatus that Menander wrote

and that Terence misunderstood his meaning. See the note on the
Pming to the ‘ Colax ’ of Menander, we find two fragments of which
we bave express traces in Terence.

In Eun. ii. 2. ⁷, the poor acquaintance of the Parasite says:
‘⁸ Quo redactus sum! omnes noti me atque amici deserunt.”

Compare Menander:

Ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ γενητὴν δύναμαι εὑρεῖν οὐδένα
ἐκ τῶν τοιούτων, καὶ ‹insama-mu μόνος.

(XM, Fragm. vii.)
“she fragment

Γέλωτι πρὸς τὸν Κύπριον ἐκθανούμενος,
(Κόλιιξ, Fragm. ii.)
is referred by Mainake to Terence, Eunuch. iii. 2. 44, 45. ·

Uar. Quid rides? Gn. Istuc quod dixti mcdo;
“Bt illud de Rhodio dictum cum in mentem venitss'

 

ξιιμ, Ιιοιέονοὲ, i· by no means a close parallel. I would rather compare
un. iii. . 4 ι

“ Risu omnes qui aderant emoriri.”

And it is not improbable that we should read ἆκθανού umet: ‘ 'rho guenta
