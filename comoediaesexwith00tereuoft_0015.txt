much use to the young or general reader, it is yet a valuable and

‘ carefully edited book.

Of other editions those that Ι have chiefly used have been that
by Perlet (Lips. 1827), Reinhardt (Lips. 1827), and Stallbaum
(Lips. 1830, 1831). The latter Ι used carefully only for the ‘Andria’
I also have referred to the edition of Dr. Hickie (London, 1837),

which is a compilation from preceding commentators without much

judgment. I have noticed his mistakes in my notes more fre-

quently than I should have done but for the fact that they are
likely to mislead younger students, by whom his book is often
used. Colman's translation of Terence I found useful3 particu-

⁷ larly as giving in an accessible shape the opinions of some of the

chief French critics upon Terence's plays.

Ι may here also gladly acknowledge my obligations to the Rev.
A. J. Macleane and. to Mr. Long‚ the editors of this series of
classical authors. To. their remarks on my notes as they have
passed through the press Ι am much indebted; and in matters con—
nected with law Ι am under particular obligations to Mr. Long‚
I had by me also, in writing the commentary on the ‘ Andriass*
some notes of the Rev. R. Shilleto's, whose permission Ι obtained,
through a pupil of his, to avail myself of them.

The life and literary position of Terence, considered as a Roman
Author, are discussed in the following Introduction. In the
same place Ι have entered at some length into the question of Teren-
tian Lan guage and Metre. This is a subject which has till lately lain

„ fallow in England since the time of Bentley and Hare ⁴. Though I

⁴ When Ι wrote this sentence 1 had not seen Mr. Key's essay ‘On the Metres of

ῑ Terence and Plautus! My only acquaintance with his researehes was through the ⁴ Varro-
ss ” nianus ¹ (see p. xxviii). Now that I have seen this paper‚ Ι may perhaps be allowed to
ξ. express my gratification that, by an independent inquiry into the usages of Terentian
Ὗ* language, 1 have arrived at results very similar to those advocated by the author ;—an

agreement which tends to confirm me in my persuasion of the justice of the principles
laid down in the following Introduction. Whenever l have reason, in my commentary, to
disagree with Mr. Key, or other writers, Ι have endeavoured to express my dissent with-
out any of that asperity which deforme the works of some modern writers.
