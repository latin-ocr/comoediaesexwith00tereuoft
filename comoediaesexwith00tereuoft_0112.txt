AN DRIA.

Memini videre : quo aequior sum Pamphilo,
Si se illam in somnis quam illum amplecti maluit.

Renuntiabo, ut pro hoc malo mihi det malum.

ACTUS SECUNDI SOENA SEXTA.

DAVUS.

SIMO.

Da. Hic nunc me credit aliquam sibi fallaciam
Portare, et ea me hic restitisse gratia.

Si. Quid Davus narrat ? Da. Aeque quicquam nunc quidem.
Si. Nihilne Ρ hem. Da. Nihil prorsus. Si. Atqui expecta-

bam quidem.

Da. Praeter spem evenit : sentio: hoc male habet virum. 5

Si. Potin es mihi verum dicere :³

Da. Nihil facilius,

Si. Num illi molestae quippiam hae sunt nuptiae

Hujusce propter consuetudinem hospitae ?
Da. Nihil hercle : aut, si adeo, bidui est aut tridui

Haec sollicitudo : nosti: deinde desinet.

Etenim ipsus secum recta reputavit via.

Ac'r II. SCENE VI. Simo endeavours
to discover from Davus whether Pamphilus
still entertains any affection for Glycerium.
Davus evades the question, and attributes
the apparent sadness of Pamphilus to mor-
tification at his father’s niggardly prepara-
tions for the wedding. At the same time
Simo suspects that some trick is in the
wind, and feels sure that whatever it is
Davus is at the bottom of it.

Metre3 Iambic trimeters.

2. Ea . . . qratia] In Plautus and Terence
the pronoun is attracted into the same case
as ‘ gratia! See Plautus, Bac. i. l. 64: “ Mea
gratia ;'’ Pseud. i. 5. 138: ‘⁶ Istac gratia ;’'
Terence, Eun. i. 2. 19: ‘⁴ Huc qua qratia te
arcessi jussi ausculta.” So ταύτην χάριν
-ὲμὴν χάριν, διο. in Greek.

3. Aeque quicquam nunc quidem] ‘Just
as much now as ever! Nothing at all new.
The sense of ¹ aequus) as that of the Gr.
ὅμοιος, is ‘all one elika! So in Plautus,
Mil. iii. 1. 188: “Aequi istuc facio‚” ‘it is
all one to me! ἴσος is used similarly in a
well known passage of Sophocles:

οὗ τᾶρα τῷ γε πρόσθεν οὐδὲν ἐξ ἴσου
χρόνῳ διοίσει γλῶσσαν. (Trach. 323.)
6. Potin es] For ⁴ Potisne es?' ⁴ Potis

sum,' ‘possuml The root of ‘potis,'
‘able,' appears in the Greek πόσις and

ποτνία. We find “potis est ?” Eun. i.

8. Hujusce propter consuetudinem Ιιοε-
pitae] This is the reading adopted by
Ritschl (Preface to Plautus, p. cccxxvii.)
on the considerations both of meti-e and
orthography. The ordinary text ‘ Propter
hujusce hospitae consuetudinem ' involves
two licences : 1. the shortening of the first
syllable of ⁸ propterz' 2. the archaic form
of the genitive3 neither of which are really
Terentian. Bentley on his own authority
has introduced this form in three places
besides the present passage—Heaut. iii. 2.
43 v. 1. 20, and Phormio iv. 2. 7, each of
which will be considered in its place. He
also clings to the idea of a neglect of the
quantity of syllables in the early part of the
line, as in ‘propter' here; but we have
seen already, and shall frequently see, that
many of his instances may be easily dis-
posed of. (See note on i. l. 15, and In-
troduction.)

ll. Etenim ipm secum reeta reputavit
m'a] ⁴ Indeed he has turned over the mat-
ter in his mind straightforwardly! This
line is very variously written in editions.
Westerhovius has “ Etenim ipsus seeum
eam rem recta reputavit via.” Bentley
would read .“ Etenim ipsus eam rem recta
reputavit via,'' rejecting ‘ secuml as a gloss.
