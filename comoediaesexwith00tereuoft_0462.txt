Aer V. 80111511 1‘11. Parmeno has just
returned from his errand to the Acropolis.
See Act iii. Scene 4. It had been 5 wild-

goose chase. Every man that came to the
Acropolis 115 had asked whether he was
from Myconus. whether his namewas Calli-
demides, whether he had any friend of the
name of Pamphilus at Athens3 but all in
vain. He now arrives as Bacchis is coming
out of Phidippus' house. She immediately
sends him off to fetch his master, and to
tell him that the ring which he gave her
some time ago has been recognized by
Myrrhina as her daughter’ s. Bacchis then
proceeds to soliloquize upon the strange
chance by which she has been the means
of restoring Pamphilus to his wife. This

115 115(1 got it from a woman whom he had
met in the street, and to whom he had
offered violence. It has now been re-
cognized by Myrrhina; and it appears that
it was Philumena whom Pamphilus met on
that occasion. In all this she has done the
best she can for Pamphilus; and has en-
deavoured to help him in his difficulty.
