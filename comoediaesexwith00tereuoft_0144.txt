24. Quadrupedem comtrinyito] In al-
lusion to the Athenian punishment called
τυφωνισμὸς, in which the criminals wore a
wooden coum· (κύφων) to which their hands
and feet were tied. It was also applied to

those who were confined in a cage of such . .

dimensione that they were compelled to
move about on all som-s. “ Multos honesti
ordinis—bestiarum more quadrupedes cavea
- coercuit,'' Suetonius, Calig. c. 27.

Ac'r V. Scnmt. 111. Pamphilus coming
out of the house of Glycerium confronts his
father, who immediately heaps reproaches
upon him, and accuses him of having sub-
orned Crito to pretend that Glycerium is an
Athenian. Pamphilus confesses his love, or
his fault if his father will have it so, and
places himself at his father's disposal. He
only entreats that the stranger may be heard,
to show that he was not in conspiracy with
him. To this Simo consents rather than
believe his son to have deceived him.

1. Omnium] He would have added ‘ ne—

quissime ’ (ὦ παγκάκιστε), hut Chremes
interposes.

3.* Gravius] ⁴ Too severe! See Adelphi
i. 2. 60: ‘⁴ Nolo in illum gravius dicer-eff
Cicero, In Verrem iii. 58: “Tu Apronium
. in tanto tuo dedecore profecto ne verbo
quidem graviore appellasse.''

5. O inqentem confidentiam] ἶ ‘O vast
effrontery !’ See note on ‘ confidens,' v. 2.
14, and compare Eun. v. l. 22, 23:

“ Vide amabo si non quum aspicias os im-
Viiigtdussis Non est ? Tum quae ejus con-
fidentia est !¹’

8. Adeo impotenti esse animo] ‘ To think
that he should be so weak.' ⁸ Inpotens)
‘wanting in sels-control,’ Gr. ἀκρατής. It
is commonly used of any uncontrolled pas-
sion, and coupled with some specific words,
fixing its sense. So Heaut. ii. 3. 13⁰: “Ego
te autem novi quam esse soleas impoteua.”
Tacitus, Hist. iv. 44: ‘⁸ Impotens amoris.''
‘⁴ Impotens irae,” Livy xxix. 9.

Praeter civium Morem] See note on i.
