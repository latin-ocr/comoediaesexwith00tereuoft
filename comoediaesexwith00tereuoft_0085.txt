Quasi exprobratio est immemoris benefici.

many other instances of violation of position
by Terence, justifying them by the consider-
ation that they occur at 1110 beginning of lines

contrary argues that all these apparent ex-
ceptione may 110 301 rid of by simple transpo-
sition, 01· 117 the expulsion of 3100000. Some
such change is needed and justifiable in 1110
text of Terence, which has certainly been
sufficiently tampered with. 1 have discussed
this question generally in 1110 Introduction.

not with ⁴benefici‚' though it is 1101
necessary, with Bentley, to read ‘imme-

years old to twenty. They were employed

Bentley adds‘ ae' aster‘ Sosia! but this
position of a monosyllabic conjunctim, com-
mencing 0 new clause at the end of a line,
is very rare, if admissible at all. Nor is
any change necessary. Simo commences
his story, and then breaks off with a re—
flection 00 1110 condition of untried boy-
hood. He then resumes afresh at v. 28,
as if no interruption had occurred. In line
25 we must pronounce ‘vivendi' as a dis·
syllable. To avoid this Bentley reads ⁸ libera
vivendi potestas ε’ but this means ‘a free
option of living,' not ‘an option of living
