8. Memoria] Bentley substitutes ⁴ ma-
litia! But Donatus gives ⁴ memoria,’ and
the sense is good without any change3
though ⁴ malitia ² is a very common word in
similar connection.

ll. Ex· ara ltine sume verbenas tibi]
‘Verbenae' is all sacred foliage, such as olive,
myrtle, laurel. See Dict. of Antiq. 1002.

Ara] On the stage stood two altars, that
on the right hand sacred to Apollo during
the person-mance of comedy (and to Bacchus
in tragedy)‚ that on the left dedicated to the
presiding deity of the games—in this case
Cybele. These altars appear sometimes to
have been used as places of refuge for slaves
and runaways. See Plautus, Mostell. v. 1.
45, and Rudens iii. 3. 27, where, however,
the altar belongs to the temple of Venus,
where a great part of the action is carried
on. There may perhaps be a more general
allusion to the altar of Apollo Ἀγυιεύς,
which stood before the doors of Grecian
houses. Aristophanes, vesp. 875: Γεῖτον
Ἀγυιεῦ τοῦ ’μοῦ προθύρου. Plautus, Bac-
chides ii. l. 3: “Saluto te, vicine Apollo,
qui aedibus propinquis nostris accolis.'' At
the entrance of Roman houses there stood
an altar of Vesta. Donatus gives a quota-
tion from Menander, which is corrupt as his
text stands, but has been thus restored:
Ἐκ δ’ ἑστίας σὺ μυρῤίνας ἔχῃς Δικτύννης.

13. Si sorte opus sicud Iterum juran-

dum mihi] ⁴ If by any chance 1 may have
to take an oath to my master! ⁴ J urandum'
is the subject and ⁴ opus ' the predicate.
Bentley proposes ⁴ jurato,' comparing Hecyra
iii. 4. 17 : ‘⁴ In arcem transcurso opus est ;''
but the text is supported by all the MSS„
and there is no necessity for an alteration.
See note on ii. l. 37, and Adelphi iii. 3. 75.
⁴ J urandum ' is used for ‘ jusjurandum.'

14. Liquido] ⁴ That I may be able to
swear with a clear conscience! Compare
Cicero, In Verr. ii. 4. 56: “Aliquid liquido
confirmare.'’ In Eun. ii. 3. 40: ⁴⁴ Illum liquet
me dejerare his mensibus Sex, septem pror-
sus, non vidisse proximis,” ‘I cau safely
take my oath that I have not seen him this
six, indeed seven, months.·’ The original
sense of ⁴ liquidus ' is ⁴ clear‚’ from ⁴ liquo,’
⁴ to clarify.’

18. Repudio] There is much difference
respecting the etymology of this word.
Some connect it with ⁴ cudo,¹ notwithstand-
ing the quantity 3 but what meaning are we
to give to the word ‘re-cudo ⁷ in this sense?
It is evidently connected with ⁴ tripudium.²
Now the original application of the word ‘ tri·
pudium ' is to the sacred dance of the Salii
(Livy i. 20), ⁴ stamping on the ground!
In its secondary meaning it meant the fnu-
ing of the grain from the mouths of the
sacred chickens. See Dict. of Antiq. p.
175, 176. Catullus uses the word, in his
