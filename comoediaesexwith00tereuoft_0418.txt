La. Pro Deum atque hominum fidem, quod hoc genus.. est,

quae haec est conjuratio.

Utine omnes mulieres eadem aeque studeant, nolintque omnia3

Itaque adeo uno animo omnes socrus oderunt nurus:

Acr II. Scarus I. Laches accuses his
wife of having made Philumena so wretched
by her ill-temper and harshness that she
has been obliged to leave her house. ‘ It is
always the same,⁷ he sayS‚ ‘ mothers-in-law
dislike their daughters-in-law. If Ι had
been here, you should have been sent pack-
ing, and she should have stayed. And this
is the way you requite me for leaving you
to yourself, and working like a slave on my
farm to support you in idleness at home.’
Sostrata replies that she is not to blame ;
but of course she does not obtain a hear-
mg.

The Metre is as follows; vv. 1—3. 5—7.
10—18, iambic tetrameter3 4. 8, 9. 19,
iambic trimeter 3 20 -— 45, trochaic tetra-
meter catalectic.

1. Quod hoc yona-9 est, quae haec· est con-
juratio] ‘What a set it is! what a con-
spiracy there is among them ! Would you
not think that all women have precisely the
same likes and dislikes ? Nor can you find any
one that swerves in the least from the gene-
ral character. And so all mothers-in-law
by one consent hate their daughters -in-law.
They are all determined to oppose their hus-
bands 3 they are all equally obstinate. They
all seem to me to be taught mischief in one
school; and I am sure that if such a school
exists, my wife here is its mistress!

2. Utine omnes] This is the reading of
the Codex Bembinus and of the Victorinus.
Bentley would alter it to ‘utne’ But the
metre requires the longer word at the com-
mencement of the line. The penultima of
‘utine’ is long. ‘Mulieres’ is a dissyllable
here. For ⁴ studeant ’ followed by the ac-
cusative see note on Andria i. 1. 32.

3. Declinatam] The word literally means
‘ turned aside ;' compare “ Modo etiam
paulum ad dexteram de via declinavi ut
ad Pericli sepulcrum accederem‚” Cicero,
De Finibus v. 2. Here it has the sense of
⁴ differing,’ ‘ turned aside from.¹ The word
is used by Quinctilian in the same sense:

“ Quaedam verborum figurae paulum figuris
sententiarum declinanturJ'

4. Itaque adeo . . . oderunt nurus] This
simple line has occasioned the greatest per-
plexity to commentators. Donatus merely
says: “ Necessaria sententiae ἀμφιβολία
ad describendam utramque personam.’' His
pupil, Jerome, in commenting on Micah c.
vii., says: “Terentius in Hecyra ⁸ Quid
hoc est,’ inquit, ‘ omnes socrus oderunt
nurus τ’ quod quanquam ambiguum sit,
tamen propemodum naturale est ut nurus
socrum, et socrus oderit nurum.” Bentley
goes still further, and pronounces thelina
spurious—(l) as deficient by one whole foot3
(2) as ambiguous; (3) as inconsistent with
the context. “Nam cum crimen aliquod
commune omnium mulierum proferatur,
male hic repente accusantur socrus. Atque
si omnium est idem studium, qui fit nt
nurus et socrus tantopere inter se discre-
pent ?” But this is criticism run mad.
Terence’s idea is very simple—(l) ‘ Women
are all alike; and so all mothers-iu-law hate
their daughters-in-law.' It is merely an
instance of the general agreement of women
in what is bad ; and it is impossible to per-
ceive any discrepancy between this general
statement—not of course meant to be press-
ed, as Bentley presses it, into an absolute
universal—and the more particular one that
mothers-in-law hate their daughters-indam.
(2) As for the ἀμφιβολία which all three
commentators insist on, it is a mere phan-
tom of their own. The point is not the
mutual feeling of mothers and daughters-in-
law towards one another; but the feeling of
mothers to daughters, which is insisted on
throughout the whole scene. (3) The ob-
jection on the score of metre is without
ground. This verse is an iambic trimeter,
as are vv. 8, 9, and 19. Weise is certainly
right in making ‘ socrus ’ a monosyllable, as
is the case with many similar words in

t'Ii'erence. On this subject see the Introduc-
ou.
