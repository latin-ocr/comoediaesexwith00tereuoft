AGTUS QUINTI SOEN A QUINTA.

'LACHE S .

PARMENO.

La. Ex meo propinquo rure hoc capio commodi,

Neque agri neque urbis odium me unquam percipit.

Ubi satias coepit fieri commuto locum.

Sed estne ille noster Parmeno? et certe ipsus est.

Quem praestolare, Parmeno, hic ante ostium Ρ ’ 5
Pa. Quis homo est P ehem, salvum te advenire, here, gaudeo.
La. Quem praestolare P Pa. Perii: lingua haeret metu.

La. Hem, quid est? quid trepidas P satin salve P dic mihi.
Pa. Here, primum te arbitrari quod res est velim ;

Aer V. Semta V. In this scene there is The word is used by Lucretius v. 1390,

8 similar contrast to that which we find in
the last. Laches, father of Phaedria and
Chaerea, is just returned from his country
seat in the suburbs, and is quietly felici-
tating himself on the comfort of being so
near to the city that he can be there or in
the country as the whim takes him. See-
ing Parmeno standing at Laches’ door he
questions him, and soon perceives by his
confusion that there is some mischief in the
wind. Parmeno in much trepidation tells
him all: and Laches hurries off to the
rescue, leaving Parmeno to reflect upon his
own coming punishment.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

2. Neque αρν-ι’ neque urbis odium me
unquam percipit] ⁴ Ι am never tired of the
country or of the city.' For ‘odium’ see
note on iii. l. 14, and compare 8 similar use
of ⁴ odium ' in the sense of ⁴ importunity ' in
Hecyra i. 2. 48: “Tundendo atque odio
denique effecit senex.’' ⁴ Percipio ' is here
used iu its original sense. ⁴ to seize upon,'
καταλαμβάνειν. Compare Plautus, Sti-
chus ii. 5. 202 ⁴⁴ Si bene facere incepit

. (mulier), ejus eam cito odium percipit.”

In Lueretius iii. 80 we find a good in-
stance of the use of both ‘odium' and
‘percipio ε’

“ Et saepe usque adeo, mortis formidine,

Paileffit humanos odium lucisque vi-

. Πξεέίὲἷῗοοιιεσίεωηὺ moerenti pectore

3. Satias] We meet with this old form
for ⁴ satietas' frequently in earlier writers.
See Hecyra iv. 2. 18: “Satias jam tenet
studiorum istorum.”

1391 :

‘⁴ Haec animos ollis mulcebant atque juva-
Culixii'I-ldgatifte cibi: nam tum sunt carmina
co 1.

5. Quem praestolare . . . ante ostium]
In Plautus and Terence ⁴ praestolor ’ is sol-
lowed by the accusative. Compare Plau-
tus, Epidicus ii. 2. 35 : ⁴‘ Quum ad portum
venio atque ego illam illic video praesto-
larier ;” and Truculentus ii. 3. 15:

⁴⁴ Sed quid>haec hic autem tamdiu ante aedes
Nessigtdtduem praestolata est.’'

In Cicero it has a dative, as in Catilin. i. 9:
‘¹ Quanquam quid ego te invitem, a quo jam
sciam esse praemissos qui tibiad forum Au-
relium praestolarentur armati ?'' The verb
is connected with ⁴ praesto ;' and in an old
inscription quoted by Forcellini we have the
form ⁴ praestus fui,' from which the adverb
is derived, and. from which we may suppose
with some etymologists the diminutive
⁴ praestulus,' whence the verb.

8. Satin salve ἵ] ⁴ Is all well ?’ This is
the reading of all the manuscripts. Linde·
mann, 011 Plautus, Trinummus v. 3. 2, main-
tains that the correct form of the phrase is
⁴ satin salvae (sc. res),’ referring to Duker’s
note on Livy i. 58. Donatus, on the other
hand, certainly considered the word to be
811 adverb, for he explains it by ⁴ integre,’
⁴ recte,’ ⁴ commode.' Plautus, in Menaech-
mei v. 2. 26, undoubtedly has the adverbial
form, ⁴⁴ Salva sis. Salven’ advenio ? Salven'
arcessi jubes ?’' Commentators are
at variance on this question ς which however
appears to be settled by the fact that we
never meet with the phrase ⁴ salvae res
