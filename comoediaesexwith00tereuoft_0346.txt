23. Hilarem hunc sumamus diem] ⁸ Let
us take this day for pleasure.' Compare v.
3. 68: “ 1 ergo intro, et cui rei est, ei rei
hunc sumamus diem.'’ Bentley would read
.‘ hilare ;’ but there is no need of any change;
and all the authorities agree in the present
reading.

Ac'r ΙΙΙ. Scmm Ι. Aeschinus had met
. vwith an Athenian maiden‚ Pamphila, daugh-
ter of Sostrata, and had offered her violence.
She is now on the point of being confined3
and her mother is introduced as consulting
,with the nurse. Aeschinus has not been to
see them to-day‚ though he is generally so
regular in his visits ; and this gives her some
disquietude.

The Metre is a mixture of trochaic and
iambic tetrameters.

Heaut. i. l. 107.

8. Ε re nata] ⁴ After what has happened,
things could not have turned out better than
they have, since your daughter has met with
a misfortune, as regards her lover more

particularly, who is a man of such a fine
disposition and belongs to so good afamily.'
A good deal of difficulty has been made
about this passage. Bentley proposes ⁴⁴ E
re natae melius fieri haud potuit.'' ‘ Things
could not have turned out more for your
daughter’s advantage! Donatus explains it
of things “quae contra voluntatem nos-
tram acciderunt. Ergo E renata, ex vitio
virginis.’' And he seems to be right.
⁸ Res nata’ is that which is beyond our own
control (ταύτόματον) and ‘ E re um’
means ⁶ after what has happened ε’ ἐκ τοῦ
νεωστὶ συμβεβηκότος. We must distin·
guish between this phrase and ‘ pro re nahu'
‘according to ‹eircumstanoesss which some
commentatore confound with it. ‘ Rea nata ’
occurs in the general sense of ⁸ the circum-
stances of the case ' in Plautus, Bacchae ii.

“ Edepol, Mnesiloche, ut rem hane natam
csse intelligo,
Quod ames paratum oet: quod des in-.
vento est opus.''
