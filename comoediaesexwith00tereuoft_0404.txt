ALTER PROLOGUS.

Orator ad vos vem'o ornatu prologi:
Sinite exorator sim, eodem ut jure uti senem

of Terence in the present passage, Paradox.
v. 2: “ Echionis tabula se stupidum detinet,
aut signum aliquod Polycleti.’' The idiom
‘occupare animum in’ occurs only in this
passage.

7. Iterum referre] Terence would not
bring it on the stage again the same day,
that he might be able to keep it back till
another occasion, and so dispose of it a
second time to the aediles, who used to
purchase plays for representation at the
games3 or to the stage-managerS, wh0‚ as
seems probable, used sometimes to purchase
plays at their own risk. See the Second
Prologue v. 49, note. See Prologue to the
Eunuchus 20, and note.

8. Alias coynoetis ejus] According to the
dates given in the Didascaliae to the Plays
of Terence, the Andria is the only play
extant of earlier date than the Hecyra,
which was brought forward a second time
in the consulship of Cn. Octavius and T.
Manlius, n. c. 165, the year subsequent ιο
the representation of the Andria. But to
which representation of the piece the pre-
sent Prologue belongs is not certain; for
not much saith can be placed in the Didas-
calia here. If this Prologue were spoken
at the last representation but one, that at
the funeral games of L. Aemilius Paullus,
as seems most probable, nc. 160, then the
poet might speak of all the existing plays,
with the exception perhaps of the Adelphi,
which was acted on the same occasion.
This view is the more probable, because we
have no reason ιο suppose that Terence wrote
any plays besides those which have come
down to us.

The art of this Second Prologue ιο the
Hecyra has been the subject of much re-
mark. It is generally supposed, and with
reason, that the Prologus was spoken on
this occasion by L. Ambivius Turpio him-

self. The occasion called for the mediation
of a well-known and favourite actm-3 and
so the poet departed from the general cus-
tom, according to which the Prologue was
entrusted to one of the inferior actors. (See
note on Andria, ’Prolog. 5—21 .) Ambivius
stood so high in the popular estimation,
that the fact of his defending a play would
go a considerable way towards ensuring its
success. On this occasion, therefore, he
artfully brings forward his own previous
success in obtaining a hearing for plays
which had not been popular at first. Cae·
cilius, he says, now a great favourite, very
often failed at first3 and not a few of his
plays were rescued by me from popular
dislike, and have now become favourites.
And so Ι encouraged the poet to write new
plays, whereas otherwise he would have
been disheartened at the opposition which
he met with. And if this holds good in
the case of Caecilius, 1 ought to gain your
attention for the Hecyra, which is the only
one of the plays of Terence which has yet
met with an unfavourable reception. The
play has been unfortunate. On·one occ·-
sion the tight—rope dancer, on another the
gladiator drew away the audience. Now
there is no distraction of the kind, and you
can attend to the play at your leisure. Ι ap-
peal to you, further, not to allow a monopoly
in the dramatic art by rejecting my poet
and accepting the plays of his opponents.
Finally, he appeals to his liberality in not
exacting too high a price for admission to
his plays3 and begs them to receive the
play favourably, that he may be encouraged'
to purchase other plays for representation.
1. Orator ad voe venio] ‘ I come before
you as a pleader in the dress of the speaker
of the Prologue; allow me to be a suc·
cessful pleader.’ ⁴ Orator' is often ‘an am-
bassador,’ as in many passages of Ia‘vy:
