Α single line may here be added from the Ὀλυνθία of Menander,
which resembles two places in Terence:

Ὡς οὔχ ὑπάρχων, ἀλλὰ τιμωρούμενος. (11.)
Compare

“ Hic respondere voluit, non lacessere ;” (Phorm. Prol. 19,)

and
“ Responsum non dictum esse, quia laesit prior.”

(Eun. Prol. 6.) >

It is possible that this line formed part of the poet’s ’defence in his
prologue against some attack. See Meineke, and compare Menander,
Fab. Incert. 297.

Τ116 foregoing parallels between Terence and his Greek orginals have
been carefully noticed‚ because they seem to give us a clue to the solu-
tion of the question of Terence's originality. A close comparison will
show that he did not at all events servilely imitate his master; that if
he copied from a Greek original, he drew with a Roman pencil, and
kept in view his own theory of dramatic excellence as well as the neces-
sity of suiting a very different audience to that which listened to
Menander. The peculiar circumstances of the Roman stage called for ,
something more varied in interest than were the plays of Menander, as
they lay ready to his hand. When he did follow the N ew Comedy most
literally‚ as in the case of the ⁴ Hecyra‚’ 1116 failure was at first most
signal. We cannot but suppose, therefore, that he should have adopted
a different plan in following attempts, and that 1116 other plays, which
all most probably were subsequent to the first representation of the
‘ Hecyra' (see note on the First Prologus, v. 8), should have been con·
structed with a more explicit intention of amusing and catching the ear
of his audience. Menander’s plays were too uneventful to suit the
Circus. This Terence remedied by uniting the plots of more than one,
and by means of a skilful bye-plot‚ such as those of the ‘Andria’ and
‘ Eunuchus‚' he kept the attention of his hearers fiom flagging. There
were many points of minor importance 111 which 116 deviated from his
original. These I will now briefly indicate, and bring into one place
the various intimations which are scattered up and down the com-
