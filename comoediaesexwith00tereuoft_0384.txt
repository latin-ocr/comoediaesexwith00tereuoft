Ita ut volumus ε video sapere, intelligere, in loco

At enim metuas ne ab re sint tamen
O noster Demea,

Attentiores sumus ad rem omnes quam sat est:

Quod illos sat aetas acuet.

character, and corresponding varieties of

behaviour. Micio is intended to be a man
who always acts from a kindly impulse3
and is not much given to ascertain the rea
sons of his conduct. Such men are always
ready with a very plausible sort of morality
at a pinch, and are the more prosy be-
cause this sort of thing is not genuine with
them.
38. Hoc licet impune facere] ‘Some
tmen will not be spoilt by a little indul-
gence in early 1ife; others will! This is
‘clearly the meaning here. Micio says,
¹ You can see by men’s characters whether
it is safe to allow them a little indulgence
or not! ‘Impune ' is used subjectively.
lt simply refers to the effect on the person's
own character, not to any external conse-
quence of indulgence or folly, such as given
in Juvenal xiii. 103—1052

Committunt eadem diverso eritli‘iiiiiltilfatm

Ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit, hic
. diadema.”

This passage is quoted by commentators
here in the usual loose manner, so as to
lead to an impl-esaion that Juvenal and
Terence mean the same, while they are
really speaking of different things.

42. Scires liberum inyem'um] ‘One could
see in a moment that they were gentlemen
in disposition and character! Here and in
Heaut. i. 2. 18 (see note) 1 have adopted
the reading proposed by Lachmann (note
on Lucretius v. 533), who obj ects to ‘est’
with the infinitive; )the ordinary reading of
this passage being‘ scire est.' ‘Scirem'
when fully expressed, means ‘even if you

knew nothing of them you could tell that y

they were gentlemen.'

49. Quod illos eat aetas acuet] ‘ A
quality which age will sufficiently ahai-pen
in them.¹ ‘ Quod ’ refers to the whole
preceding sentence, ⁴ Attentiores sumus ad
rem omnes quam sat est!

53. Exporqe frontem] ⁶ Be chem-ful!
⁴ Expers-igere ' is literally ⁶ to stretch out,’ and
is opposed to ‘ contrahere frontem‚’ ‘to wrin-
kle the forehead! We find ‘ explico ' used
similarly in Horace, Carm. iii. 29. 13-16 ε

“ Plerumque gratae divitibus vices,
Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum
Coenae sine aulaeis et ostro
Sollicitam explicuere frontem.''

Compare also Plautus, Casina ii. 4. 3:

“Primum ego te porrectiore fronte volo
mecum loqui.''
