Plz. Quia paulum vobis accessit pecuniae,

ex fano Chrysae praeter unum perparvulum
signum ex aere desideratum est.” Some-
times in Cicero it has the sense of our
derived word ‘desire.’ See examples in
Forcellini. Here Pamphilus says that al-
though' circumstances have made it neces-
sary for him to part from his wife, he still
loves and esteems her, and regrets her
loss.

43. Tibi id in manu est ne fiat] ‘ You
have it in your own power to prevent that.y
Compare iv. 4. 44: “Uxor quid faciat in
manu non est mea.'' ‘ In manu esse ' was
⁶ to be in a person's power! Hence in the
marriage ‘ per conventionem in manum ¹ the
wife became dependent on her husband, or
on him in whose power her husband was.
(See Dictionary of Antiquities, art. ‘Ma-
trimonium,’ pp. 740—742.) Compare Livy
xxxiv. 7 : “Et vos in manu et tutela, non
in servitio debetis habere eas ;” and xxxix.
*182 “Mulieres damnatas cognatis aut in
quorum manu essent tradebant, ut ipsi in
privato animadverterent in eas.'’ Hence we
have the general phrase ⁶ in manu est,' ‘it
is under my controL' ‘it is within my
power. ' Tacitus, Histor. ii. 76.
deos, in tua manu positum est.”
Ad Fam. xiv. 2: “Haec non sunt in manu
nostra. ” Few words appear in a greater
number of phrases than ‘.manus ² See
note on‘ prae manu, ’Adelphiv. 9. 23.

naturally they quarrel over it.

52. Renumeret dotem huc,- eal] Phi-
dippus says, ‘ If he wishes to take his wife
back, let him. If he is not so minded, let
him pay me back her dowry, and be off!
According to Roman law the wife's dower
became the husband's property, but con-
tinued so only while their union lasted. In
the case of separation, the woman, or her
father, could bring an action forits resti-
tution. Under the Greek law a similar
provision existed. See this whole subject
in the Dietionary of Antiquities‚ ‘Dosl
‘ Huc' is equivalent to ‘mihil See note
on Andria i. 5. 51. The behaviour of Phi-
dippus is very natural. He thinks that
Pamphilus is giving himself great airs, and
that his father is inclined to support him
because they have come in for a fortune.

54. Percontumax] Donatus says ⁴⁴ Pro-
prie contumax· dicitur contemptu potiorum‚”
apparently alluding to the derivation of the
word from ¹ contemno! It is, however,
more probably connected with ‘tamem'
⁴ Nobis ’ is a translation of the Greek ἡμῖν.
The whole passage looks like a close imita-
tion; it is more terse and abrupt than Latin
dialogus generally is. We may imagine the
original line to have run κατῆλθες ἡμῖν,
Πάμφιλ’, αὐθαδέστερος. Afterrelieving him.
self of his anger, Phidippus goes off in a
rage. All the usual forms of leave· taking
are omitted here, to mark the angry sepa-
ration of the speakers.
