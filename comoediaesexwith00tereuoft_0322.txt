PROLOGUS.

POSTQUAM Poeta sensitscripturam suam

Ab iniquis observari, et adversarios

Rapere in pejorem partem quam acturi sumus,

Indicio de se ipse erit3 vos eritis judices

Laudine an vitio duci id factum oporteat. 6
Synapothnescontes Diphili comoedia est.

The Prologue alludes to the general
charges brought against the poet by his
opponents3 but more particularly meets
the accusation that he was assisted in his
writings by his eminent friends. The first
charge seems, as before, to have been one of
plagiarism (see Prologue to Eunuchusv
22—26). This the poet does not wait to

¹ answer3 but he says that he will inform

against himself ε and he leaves it to his audi-
ence to judge whether he is to be blamed or
not. His plagiarism consists in having bor-
rowed from the ‘ Synapothnescontes ¹ of
Diphilus the incident of the capture of the
girl in Sannio's house, which had been
omitted by Plautus in his translation of the
play under t'he name of ‘ Commorientes!
And this passage the poet has transferred
word sor word into the ⁸ Adelphi‚’ an in-
stance rather, he thinks, of successful revi-
sion of an old play, than of any theft from
Plautus. And as for the second accusation,
that certain illustrious persons help the
poet in his writings3 this is rather a sub-
ject of praise than of blame. For why
should not the poet gladly avail himself of
their help, whose help every one else is very
glad to have in the ordinary concerns of
life? As to the argument of vthe play, the
old men who come on the stage in the first
act will explain part of it, and the rest
they will develope in acting their part. The
poet has only to beg the indulgence of
the audience as an ennom-agemont to future
labours.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

Prologues to the preceding plays.

4. Indicio de se ipse erit] ‘He will
inform against himself. ‘Indicium pro-
fiteri,’ or ‘proferress is to turn king’? evi-
dence against a fellow- criminal. as ‘indi-

ν. cium postulare’ is to offer to turn king's

evidence. Compare Cicero, In Q Caeci-

lium Divinatio, cap. ll: “Quapropter si
tibi indicium postulas dari quod tecum una
fuerit, concedo, si id lege permittitur‚” where
see Long’s note. Ritschl (Prolegomena
ad Plautum, p. 119) proposes to omit ‘ erit!
He would read':

‘⁴ Indicio de se ipse, vos eritis judices.”

But Donatus had both words3 and although
it is very possible that the true reading may
be‘ eritis vos,' out of which the present
text may easily have arisen, yet we cannot
change the reading without some autho-

rity

6. Synapothnescontes Diphili] Diphi-

lus was a contemporary of Menander, a
native of Sinope, famous.for his wit and
sententious humour, κωμικώτατος καὶ γνω-
umba-arog. We are not infor-med what
was the argument of the Συναποθνὴσκον-
τες; but it is not improbable that it was
in part at least a burlesque of the ¹ Iphigenia
at Tauris,' for the common practice of the
writers of the New Comedy was to imitate
Euripides. This play Plautus Latinum,
leaving out this particular scene which Te-
rence here mentions. Others have asserted
that Plautus was not the author of the
