'Ilibi narret?

Ac'r V. Scanr. VIII. Nausistrata, hear-
ing herself called, comes out and inquires
the meaning of this disturbance at her door.
Phormio at once tells her about Chremes’
Lemnian affairs, in spite of much interrup-
tion from both the old men. Nausistrata
is sufficiently angry at hearing these news;
while Demipho endeavours to pacify her.
Phormio glories over the unfortunate
Chremes, and promises to punish in the
same way any one that annoys him. Find-
ing >that Demipho’s arguments are prevailing
with Nausistrata, he takes the opportunity
of telling her the whole story of the thirty
minae, and how he had employed them for
Phaedria. Nausistrata determines to see
Phaedria, and place the whole matter at his
disposal. She expresses a wish to repay
her obligation to Phormio, which he cha-
racteristically acknowledges by telling her
to ask him to supper3 and so the play
concludes.

The Metre is as followsg l—2l,iambic
trimeterg 22—66‚ trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectio.

2. Ehem, quid nunc obstipuisti ?] The
readings ‘obsmpuisti' and ‘obticuisti ' occur
here; but the text isgiven by the Bembine
manuscript. ’ Compare Andria i. 5. 2l;
Adelphi iv. 4. 5.

4. Ονεάααε] In Plautusfwe have the

De. Scelus l

old forms‘ creduamst ‘creduas, ⁹ ‘fu-edunt
and‘ creduis, ‘creduitl in many places.

8. Delirat miser timore] ‘The wretched
man is mad with fear! ‘Delimre' is
properly to ‘swerve from the straight
line in ploughing! ⁴ Lira' is the ridge
between two furrows, also from its shape
called ‘porca,' or ‘hog’s back ;' in some
writers ⁴ lira' and ‘porca' are disfinctly
identified, while others seem to consider
‘ lira ⁷ to be the same as ⁴ sulcus! ‘ Salem?
or ὁλκός, necessarily means no more than
‘a drawn line,’ the idea of depth being
entirely adventitious; and of course wher-
ever there was a ‘lira' there would be a
‘sulcus' too. ‘ Lirare'* is to turn the
ridges overKseed which has been planted in>
the furrow. See Forcellinir on both words.
‘Non temere est’ occurs in Hcaut. iv.

10. Recte sane] ‘ Oh, not at allg anda}
you are not at all afraid, and what 1 say is
nothing, do you tell it.⁷ For this sense of
‘recte ¹ see note on Eunuchus ii. 3. 50.

12. Eho tu, factum est abs tepiedulo
pro fratre] ‘Ah you! you have done capi-
tally for your brother? Phormio implica
that if it had not been for Demipho' s ag-
gravation he would not have appealed to
Nausistrata, and disclosed to her the history
of chremes³1ove affairs at Lemnos.
