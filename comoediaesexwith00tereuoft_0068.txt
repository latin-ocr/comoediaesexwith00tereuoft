an iambic tetrameter:

υΙ-ί-υ-υΙ-Λυ-υΙ -’-υ-υ Ι-’ψ-
“ Dum Ι tempus ad eam Ι rem tulit sivi Ι animum ut explerlet suum'3’'

but in the case of the iambic tetrameter catalectic he preservesthe
arrangement of iambic dipodiae:

υ-Δυ-Ιυέυ-Ιυ-ὐ--Ιυ-ὐ

“Nam si remitltent quippiam Ι Philumenam Ι dolores.”

Iambic verses, however, have their own arrangement of dipodiae‚ or
matres, and it is more convenient in speaking of these verses to eom-
· mence the line with an iambic measure (u L u -), and to measure the
verse by a succession of these measures rather than by trochaic. The
system adopted by Bentley and others involves a breach of the laws of
caesura3 some having even supposed that in iambic and trochaic verse;
there is a legitimate caesura at the end of every dipodia. Of iambic
verses we have the following kinds used in Terence:

I. IAMmc Tarnamnruu CATALEOT10‚ called also septenarius and
Comicus Quadratus (as being confined to Comedy ⁵) ; consisting of four

iambic dipodiae‚ deficient by one syllable.

υ-ίυ--Ι ό-υ-Ιυ-ὐ-Ιυ-ὐ
The CAESURA in this metre falls at the end of the fourth foot, which
must always be an iambus.
The iambic septenarius appears to have been conceived as wymundus,

or composed of two independent parts3 thus

The fourth foot is therefore treated as strictly as the end of an iambic

verse. Accordingly we find many verses in Plautus and Terence in ’

which the fourth foot is terminated by a short syllable, as at the end
of a line, or where there is an Hiatus after the fourth foot. The follow-

ing lines from Plautus and Terence exemplify'this peculiarity:
“ Sed si tibi vilginti minae ΙΙ argenti prolferentuff’ ⁴
“ Tuo nos vocalbis nomine? ΙΙ Libertos non Ι patronos ?’'
“ Id potius vi'ginti minae ΙΙ hic insunt in Ι crumena.”
“ Etsi scio ego Ι Philumena ΙΙ meum jus esse ut Ι te cdgam.”

⁵ 'rho so called ⁴ politieal verses ' of the later Greeks were written in this metro.
