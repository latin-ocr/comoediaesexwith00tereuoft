ejiciat as eiciat, And. ii 3. 8.
objicerem as cicerem, Heaut. i. 2. 12.
conjicio as concio, Heaut. i. 1. 11.

In these and many other cases, as in alius always, in facio, faciam, Soc.
(see particularly Phorm. ii. 3. 47, “Di tibi male faciant ;” v. 3. 2, “ Ut
si'la voluntate id quod est faciendum faciat. Faciam ⁹³), the ‘i ’ has the
force of ‘ y,’ and coalesces with the following vowel ⁹.

We find many instances in Terence of the contra&i0n of words in
which ‘ i’ is repeated. In these cases the result is that the word '
generally loses one of its consonante with one vowel in pronunciation3
as μ
, amicitia (= amitia)‚ Andria iii. 3. 5. Hec. v. 1. 38. Heaut. i. 1.

5, Suc. ·

imimicitz‘a (= inmitia), Phormio ii. 3. 23. Andria v. 2. 11, 850.

pudicitia (= puditia), Andria i. 5. 53.

Sometimes one only of the two vowels is lost in the eona-aetion, as in
Hecyra ii. 1, 6:

“ In eodemque omnes mihi videntur 11'1d0 doctae ad mdlitiaan‚’'

where malitiam = mal'tiam, and in Heaut. i. 2. 9, where we have
pueritia z puertia, as in Horace, Oarm. i. 36. 8.

familia (= famlia), Heaut. v. 1. 36. Adelph. ii. 1. 9, ὥσ.

mulier, mulieres, δια, are pronounced mulyer, mulyerec.
They occur very frequently, and in them the ‘ i’ must generally have
the force of ‘ y.' I may notice, however, one instance in which mulieres
must be pronounced as a. dissyllable, viz. Hecyra ii. 1. 2 :

“ Utine omnes muliere‘s eadem aeque studeant noluitque omnia ?”

All such words as hujus, cujus, efjuc, ei, prius, are commonly used by
Terence as monosyllables2 I may add here the universal contraction of
the genitive of the second declension‚ as ‘consili,’ ‘viti,' preti.’ As a
general rule this is the only inflection of any noun that admits of

Α

synizesis¹. Thus we could not have such forms as ‘mendacia,' ‘mor-

9 The following are some of the numerous words in which this takes place :—‘ Grandi-
usculus,' ⁴periimus,' ‘perierim,' ‘abiero,’ ‘praeterieris,' ‘redierit.¹ Accordingly ‘abiero,'&c.,
stand as cretica at the end of au iambic line, being pronounced abyero, mayerh, pnyerim,
perfinita. within the limite of this Introduction it is impossible to enumerate all the
inmunes of words= in which ‘i' disappears, or throws out a neighbouring consonant in
pronunciation. Τὶιθ words specified will serve as fair examples of the rule.

¹ Ritschl makes an exception to this rule in the case of octonarii, and anapaeetic verse.
