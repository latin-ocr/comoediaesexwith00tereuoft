PHORMIO.

Tenui esse oratione et scriptura levi3 5
Quia nusquam insanum scripsit adolescentulum

Cervam videre fugere, et sectari canes,

Et eam plorare, orare ut subveniat sibi.

Quod si intelligeret, olim quum stetit nova,

Actoris opera magis stetisse quam sua, 10
Minus multo audacter quam nunc laedit laederet.

N unc si quis est qui hoc dicat, aut sic cogitet;

5. Tenui esse oratione et scriptura levi]
Donatus very well says: ‘⁴ Imperitum in-
ducit criminatorem, qui hoc objiciat quod
proprium debet esse comici stili.'’ ‘ Oratio ’
refers to the language, as in Heaut. Prol.
44: “In hac est pura oratio‚” ⁴ In this
play my language is plain.y ‘ Scriptura ’ is
more properly applied to the style. So in
Andria, Prolog. ll, we have a similar dis-
tinction drawn:

“ Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed
Dissffiffli oratione sunt factae ac stilo.”

Terence means to say that he is accused of
using too plain common-place language, and
of a want of vigour in his style. What he
mentions in the Prologue to the Heauton-
timorumenos as a merit of his plays, is here
noticed as a defect. The author of the
treatise ‘ Ad Herennium,' iv. 8, explains
⁸ attenuata oratio ' as follows: “ Attenuata
autem est quae demissa est usque ad usita-
tissimam puri sermonis consuetudinem.”
Compare Horace, Sat. i. 4. 542

“Non satis est puris versum describere
verbis,

and the passage from Gellius quoted by Mr.

*Macleane, in the note on that passage. It
was the peculiar character of the New
‚Comedy that it represented on the stage
the characters and language of every-day
life3 and this feature seems to have been
preserved more scrupulously by Terence
than by Plautus, to whose rough humour
the Roman audience were accustomed. The
epigram attributed to Caesar touches this
point exactly:

“Tu quoqne, tu, in summis, Ο dimidiata
Menander,
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.
Lenibus ‚atque utinam scriptis adjuncta
Coiiiiiajiilz aequato virtus polleret honore
Cum Graecia, neque hac despectus parte
Uxiii‘iiirlisdc macen-oret doleo tibi deesse,
Terenti.”

6.] Terence no doubt introduces here an
incident from one of Lavinius’ plays, in
which he certainly departed sufficiently from
every-day life. This scene of the ‘ Charmed
Fawn’ may have been an adaptationi of
some fable like that of Actaeon—a lover
seeing his mistress turned into a fawn, and
the dogs pursuing it while she moeste him
to help her—incongruous enough for a co-
medy. Plautus introduces a kind of sablo
now and then; but it is aa a dream. See
Mercator, Act ΙΙ. Scene i., and Rudens,
Act 111. Scene i. In the Prologue to the
Heautontimorumenos we have an insumo
of a similar breach of good taste on the
partos Lavinius. See note on v. 3⁰. He
seems to have aimed at oeeating sturning
situations3 and his plays must have been
very unlike Terence’s more quiet plote.

9. Olim quum stetit ηονα] ‘When his
new play was originally received! Com-
pare Hecyra, Prolog. Alter 6, 7, for tho nse
ο ⁴ stetit:’

“ In his quas primum Caecili didici novas
Passfflsi'aium earum exactus, partim vig
ἱ

and Horace, Epist. ii. 1. 175, 6 ε

“ Gestit enim. nummum in loculos demit-
tere, post hoc
Securus cadat an recto stet fabula talo-’⁹

The old⁸ editions read ‘quum stetit olim
nova‚' and this order is adopted by soum
later editors3 but ·many good authorities
have the words transposed as in the text.
This retort of Terenee's, about the merita
of Lavinius' actor, applies tolerably exaetly
to the Hecyra. See notes on the Secum!
Prologue.

11.] After this line the common text has

the words
‘¹ Et magis placerent quas fecisset fabulas ;”

but this is evidently an interpolation fium
Andria, Prolog. 3, and is quite out of placo
here; nor does it appear in the Bembiue,
vatican, or Victorian MSS. ⁴
