Da. Numquid, Geta, aliud me vis? Ge. Ut bene sit tibi.
Puer, heus. Nemone huc prodit? Cape, da hoc Dorcio.

94. Quid paedayoyus ille, qui citharis-
triam ?] ¹ And what of that young paeda-
gogue who was in attendance on the dancing
girl ?’ For the idea of ⁶ paedagogus’ see
note on v. 22. One of the duties of the
‘ paedagogus’ was to escort his pupils to
and from school, to carry their bag of books,
&c. The rich had ‘capsarii’ for this last
office. See Macleane on Horace, Sat. i.
6. 74. Phaedria is therefore humorously
called ‘paedagogus ¹ in consequence of his
constant attendance on the music girl as she
went to her school and back. In Plato,
Republic 390, Phoenix is called the παι-
δαγωγὸς ofAchilles: οὐδὲτὸντοῦ Αχιλλέως
παῑδίῖγωγὸν ΦΟ 01111160 Επαίνὲῗέθν, ὡς μξΤρί-
ως ἔλεγε, συμβουλεύων aha-cp, δῶρα μὲν
λαβόντι, ἀπαμύνει) τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς· ιιι ευ δὲ
δώρων, μὴ ἀπαλλάττεσθαι τῆς μήνιδος.
Plutarch tells us that Fabius was derisively
called the ‘paedagogus' of Hannibal, be-
cause he followed him about (Fabius Maxim.
cap. 5). Perlet quotes from Suetonius an
instance of a slave who turned these school
trips to good account. “Remnius Palae-
mon, Vincentius, mulieris verna, primo (ut
ferunt) textrinam, deinde, herilem filium
dum comitatur in scholas, literas didicit3
postea manumissus docuit Romae,” De
Illustr. Gramm. 23. Perlet however is
without reason in drawing a distinction be-
Ween ‘magister’ and ‘ paedagogus! The
ellipse of the verb, as in this passage, is
very common with Terence.

95. Sic tenuiter] See note on Andria
iv. 5. 9. ⁸ How does he get on ?' says Da-
vus. ‘ But poorly, only so s0.’

100. Et ad portitores esee delatam]

‘Portitores’ was the ordinary name for
the agents of the‘ publicaniss or collector-s
of the⁴vectiga1ia’or‘portoria.’ We may

compare them generally with our custom-
house officers. See the Dictionary of An-
tiquities. But Donatus suggests that the
word is not used here' in the Roman sense.
It is commonly applied to Charon by the
Latin poets in the sense of ‘ferryman.'

(See) Virgil, Georg. iv. 502. Propertius v.
ιν ll. 7.

“Vota movent superos.
recepit,
obserat herbosos lurida porta rogos.''

And so some consider them tohave been letter
carriers. At all events we find that they
had the power of opening and examining
the contents of letters3 see Plautus, Tri-
nummus iii. 3. 65—67, where the debate' ιε
how to bring a letter without a certain seul
on it. ·Ob‚’ says Megaronides, ‘that is
easy enough. The seal may have been
lost; a new one may have been made3 or
he may bring it open ;'

Ubi portitor aera

“Jam si obsignatas non feret, diei hoc
Aii'sdterigrtitores eas resignatas sibi
Inspectasque esse.”

This inclines me to identify them with the
ordinary Roman officers.

101. Numquid aliud me vis ?] See note
on Eunuchus i. 2. ill.

102. Da hoc Dorcio] Geta calls one of
the under slaves, and gives him the money
which Davus has paid him, telling him to
take it in to his wife. The form of the
word ⁴ Doreium ’ shows that it is the name
of a woman, as Glycerium, Phanium, Pla-
nesium, and many others. In Adelphi v.
9. 16 we meet with Phrygia, the fellow-
slave and wife of Syrus.
