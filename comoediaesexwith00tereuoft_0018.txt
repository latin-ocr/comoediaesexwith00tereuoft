his party at supper. After the meal was over, the remainder of the
play was read, was highly approved by his audience, and was recom-
mended to the Aediles by Caecilius. He wrote and exhibited six ’
comedies, in the following order: ¹

The Andria. The Eunuchus.
The Hecyra.. The Phormio.
The Heautontimorumenos. The Adelphi.

Of these the ‘ Eunuchus ' is said by some to have been acted twice in

the same day ; and the ‘ Phormio ' to have been acted four times in the .
same year (but see the notes on the Inscriptions to those plays). In .,

consequence of the success of his plays he was accused of receiving the ,help

of his noble friends in their composition ; a charge which will be consi· ⁴
dered more fully hereafter. ¹Of the rest of his life little is known. He .
is said to have left Rome in the thirty-fifth year of his age, on a visit to ζ

Greece3 a voyage from which he. never returned. The following lines,
alluding to this event, are attributed to Volcatius:

“ Sed ut Afer sex populo dedit comoedias,
Iter hinc in Asiam fecit ς navem cum semel
Conscendit visus nunquam est 3 sic vita vacat.’'

 

He is supposed to have been lost at sea on his return to Italy 3 and with ·
him perished translations of several comedies of Menander which he had ἶῗ
made during his visit to Athens. Another account is that he died at ’ἦ

Stymphalus in Arcadia of an illness brought on by grief for the loss of
those pieces which he had sent before him to Rome. At the ’time of his
death he is said to have possessed some property on the Appian Road

. near Villa Martis. One daughter survived him, afterwards the wife of a

Roman senator. The writer of the following lines, summing up the
brief narrative of his life, says that he died in extreme poverty, and that

his visit to Greece was occasioned by the loss of his property. The lines s

are attributed to Porcius ε

“ Dum lasciviam nobilium et fucosas laudes petit 3
Dum Africani vocem divinam inhiat avidis auribus ;
Dum ad Furium se coenitare et Laelium pulchrum putat3
Dum se amari ab hisce credit, crebro in Albanum rapi
Ob florem aetatis suae ; ipsus sublatis rebus ad summam
Inopiam redactus. est.
