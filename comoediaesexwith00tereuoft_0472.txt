398 IN TRODUGTION TO PHORMIO.

Antipho got into a similar serape, which had a very different end, but
one quite as embarrassing to him. For when Chremes reached Lemnos
he found that his birds had fiown. Phanium and her mother, tired of
waiting for him, now that Phanium was grown up, had started for
Athens in search of him, with their nurse Sophrona. They inquire
every where for Stilpho, but no such person is to be heard of, and-they
are reduced to great distress, in consequence of which the mother dies
soon after their arrival. By a singular chance Antipho happens at this
moment to see Phanium, as she is lamenting the death of her mother,
and falls desperately in love with her at first sight. He goes to

. Sophrona, who will not consent to allow any acquaintance but on con-

dition of marriage3 and Antipho will sacrifice himself to a girl without
a penny rather than lose her altogether. But how is the marriage to
be brought about without exposing Antipho to his father’s most severe
censure? It is managed in the following way. Phormio, a parasite,
who seems to have been under considerable obligations to these young
men in the way of good living (see ii. 2. 22), gives him this advice.
There is an Athenian law, that orphans should be taken in marriage
or portioned out by their nearest relation. He will pretend to be
Phanium’s guardian, and will bring an action against Antipho, as her
nearest relation, and as Antipho has no money he will of course be
obliged to marry her. So Demipho will not be able to say a word.
The plan succeeds to admiration. Phormio gains his suit, and Antipho
immediately marries Phanium. He is dev'oted to his wife, but lives in
continual dread of his father’s return3 and is quite as wretched in
consequence of his success as Phaedria is because his case is hopeless.
At this point (Act i. Sc. 4) the action of the play commences.
Demipho comes back from Cilicia, and immediately hears the unwel-
come news that his son has married a pauper3 and he at once attacks
Geta, Antipho having made a hasty retreat, who defends himself as best>
he‘ can, and begins the second plot which they have in hand for-
'obtaining money for Phaedria, who is now driven to the last extremity3
for Dorio has given him notice that if ‘thirty minae are not forthcoming
. by the next day, Pamphila, the music girl, will be sold. Geta pretends
therefore that Phormio will be very glad to take Phanium off their
hands if they will make it worth his while to do so3 for he has certain
debts, and is already under an engagement to marry a lady w‘bo will
bring him a sufficient 'portion to enable him to clear them off. He
must therefore have thirty minae, and he will settle the matter for them.
After some trouble the affair is arranged. Phormio receives the money,
and at, once carries it off bo Phaedria, who purchases his Pamphila at
once, and is made* supremely happy3 while poor Antipho is more
wretched than ever, and accuses Geta of blundering stupidity in thus
