HEOYRA.

Spe incerta certum mihi laborem sustuli.

Easdem agere coepi ut ab eodem alias discerem

Novas studiose, ne illum ab studio abducerem.
Perfeci ut spectarentur. Ubi sunt cognitae,

Placitae sunt.

Prope jam remotum injuria adversarium

Ab studio atque ab labore atque arte musica.

Quod si scripturam sprevissem in praesentia,
Et in deterrendo voluissem operam sumere,
Ut in otio esset potius quam in negotio,
Deterruissem facile ne alias scriberet.

Nunc quid petam mea causa aequo animo attendite.

Hecyram ad vos refero, quam mihi per silentium

Numquam agere licitum est;

10
Ita poetam restitui in locum

20
ita eam oppressit calamitas.

Eam calamitatem vestra intelligentia
Sedabit, si erit adjutrix nostrae industriae.

Quum primum eam agere coepi, pugilum gloria,

is simple enough, though it is not very
plainly expressed. Ambivius knew that his
success was uncertain, and yet he incurred
the certain expense and trouble of prepa-
ring these plays for representation.

10. Ut ab eodem alias discerem novas]
‘ ‘ l began to act the rejected plays to the
best of my ability, that Caecilius might
give me fresh plays to learn, that I might
not diseonrage him from his profession.'
The poet would probably not train the
chorus himself ; but would leav'e that to
his manager, Ambivius, who held the posi-
tion of the Greek χοροδιδάσκαλος. (See
note on the Inscription to the Andria.) But
Ambivius would need instruction from the
poet in the design of the play, and the par-
ticular force to be given to each part of the
dialogus. These general instructions given,
the managei· would then drill his company
in their respective parts, and look to the
proper scenio representation of the piece.

15. Arte musica] ‘From the art of
poetry.' For the meaning of ‘ musicus ’ in
Terence see notes on Heaut. Prolog. 23.
Eunuchus iii. 2. 23. The same opposition
that Caecilius encountered from the rivals
who wished to exclude him from the stage,
is noticed briefly in Terence’s case below,
v. 38, 39, and more fully in the Prologue
to the Phormio, v. 16-18, See notes on
both passages. “

16. In praesentia] See note on Heaut.
v. 2. 9. ·

20-37.] He now pasees to the particular

case of the Hecyra, and proceedsto account
for its previous failures. The fact is that
it has never had a hearing. On each
occasion of its representation some show or
other has disti-acted the people, so that,
what with tight-rope dancers, boxel-s, and
gladiators, they have been unable to give
their attention to it. For the meaning of
‘calamitas' in v. 22, see note on v. 2 of
the first Prologue.

25.] The following passage shows us
briefly with what distracting atti-actions the
Roman comedy had to contend. It was
acted on an open stage facing towards both
ends of the amphitheatre, and consequently
the performers might frequently be inter-
rupted by the gladiatorial shows and other
exhibitions which took place at the same
gamen. See Macleane's note on Horace,
Epist. ii. l. 186. The Prologus to the Poe-
nulus of Plautus gives us an amusing sketch
of the various interruptions which took place
among the audience themselves. The fol-
lowing lines are worth quoting ε

“ Scortum exoletum ne quis in prosce-

Sediezt, neu lictor verbnm aut virgae
muttiant3

Neu designator praeter os obambulet,

Neu sessum ducat, dum histriobin scena

Diiietiili domi otiosi dormierunt decet

Animo {equo nunc stent, vel dormire tem-
peren .
