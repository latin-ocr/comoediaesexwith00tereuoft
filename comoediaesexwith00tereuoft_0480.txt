PHORMIO.

Jampridem apud me reliquum pauxillulum

Nummorum ; id ut conficerem. Confeci: affero.

Nam herilem fflium ejus duxisse audio 5
Uxorem: ei, credo, munus hoc corraditur.

Quam inique comparatum est hi qm· minus habent

Ut semper aliquid addant divitioribus.

Quod ille unciatim vix de demenso suo,

Suum defrudans genium, comparsit miser,

Id issa universum abripiet, haud existimans

“Beatus videor: subduxi ratiunculum,
Quantum aeris mihi sit quantumque alieni
siet.’

Davus is made to use diminutives in speak-
ing of his debt to Geta, to show, as
Donatus says, that there was very little
money belonging either to Geta or to
Davus, while yet out of that little they had
to find the means of making presents to
their masters and mistresses. For ‘ con-
ficerem ³ compare v. 5. ll z ‘⁴ Ne quum hic
non videant me conficere credant argentum
suum;’' and see note on Heaut. iv. 5. 55.
Compare also Cicero, Pro Cluentio, c. 25:
“Post exoratus initio permagnam pecuniam
poposcit; deinde ad id pervenit quod confici
potuit, et sestertium sexcenta quadraginta
millia deferri ad se domum jussit.” The
clause ‘id ut conficerem’ depends on the
idea of ‘oravit‚' or some such word, im-
plied in ¹ ad me venit? For another sense
of ¹ conficio) which is common in Terence,
see not-e on Eunuchus v. 4. 6.

7-12.] Colman has translated these
lines very well z ’

“ Alack, how hard it is
That he who is already poor should
Thi-tdlvir in his mite to swell the rich man’s
Wiiiizplie scarce, ounce by ounce, from
short allowance,
Sorely defrauding his own appetite,
Has spared. poor wretch! shall she
sweep all at once,
Unheeding with what labour it was

got.’'

7. Quam inique comparatum eet] ‘ How
3pf13irlg4ffioigarranged! Compare Heaut.

“ Ita comparatam esse hominum naturam
221}ssssss 'iiin &eiius videant et dijudicent
Quam sua ?”

and see note on Eunuchus i. 1. 2.

 

9. De demenso suo] ⁴ From his scanty
allowance.' The ⁴ demensum ’ was the daily
or monthly allowance of slaves. Donatus
says that they were allowed four modii a
month. Seneca (Ep. 80), quoted by For-
cellini, says that they were allowed five.
Plautus Stichus i. 2. 3,mentions the monthly
allowance:

“Vos meministis quotcalendis petere de-
mensum cibum3
Qui minus meministis quod opus sit facto
facere iu aedibus ?'’

Horace speaks of the daily allowance in
Epist. i. 14. 40:

“. Cum servis urbana diaria rodere mavis.”

See Macleane's note there, aud ou Sat. i. 6.
68 ; and for other information connected
with this subject see the Dictionary of Anti·
quities, ⁴ Servus-³3 p. 1041, b.

10. Suum dffrudam qoniam] ¹ Starv·
ing himself all the while.’ ⁸ Defrudo ’ is
used sometimes by Plautus and Terence for
‘ defraudo] We may compare the con·
nexion of ‘ claudo ' and ‘ cludo.' See notos
on Andria iii. 3. 41, and Eunuchus i. 2. 84.
The phrase ‘ defraudare genium ' is oppooed
to ⁸ genio indulgere‚' and simply means ‘to
stint oneself in food.’ Compare Plautus,
Aulularia iv. 9. 13:

“ ——— Egomet me defraudavi
Animumque meum geniumque meum.”

In Adelphi ii. 2. 37 the word is used iu its
simple meaning of ⁴ to cheat!

Comparsit] ‘ comparsit,’ for the regular·r
form, ⁴ compersit‚' means ‘has got together
by saving! Compare the use of ‘parsit’
Hecyra iii. 1. 2, note.

11.] ‘And this she will carry off in the
lump,' he says, ‘little thinking with what
difficulty it was got! The words are very
carefully chosen through this whole sentence3
the contrast between ⁸ unciatim ' and ‘uni-
versum,’ ‘comparsit ' and ‘abripiet3' and
between the clauses ⁶ suum defrudans ge-
