Ac'r V. ScENa V. Syrus comes to fetch
Demea. to the wedding, and is received
with unusual civility by the old man, who
congratulates himself upon the success
with which he has caught the knack of
civility.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

5. Servum haud illiberalem praebes te]
‘ You are not a bad slave in your beha-
viour!= ‘ Liberalis’ is the opposite to
‘ servilis ς’ and we must bear this in mind,
though it is difficult to convey the idea in
English. Compare Andria i. Ι. ll:

‘⁴ --— Feci e servo ut esses libertus mihi,
Propterea quod servibas liberaliter.”

7. propediem] ⁴ Prope ’ originally was a
preposition governing the accusative case,
as in Caesar, Bell. Gall. i. 222 ‘⁴ Nisi ipsius
cogiae prope hoeltium eaHstra visaehessenttss''
ἲνῖο bbrrlilsiiluyngt‘ ἴτῒροωέιῖιξιῖιῗθ* 1ιὲΣῖ thg
measure‚’ ‘almost ς’ and ⁸ propediem( ‘near
the present day,' ‘ soon ;’ both used aeldom

lgy {lautus and Terence, more frequently
y mero.

Aer V. Scamz VI. Demea follows out
his plan of compliments with Geta, who
comes from Sostrata's house to see about
the arrangements for the wedding. He is
much pleased with his success here as be-
fore, and feels that he is attaching every one
to him by his new tactics.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

1. Hera, eqo ad Ιιοε provisam] ‘ Ῐ am
going over to our neighbour’s, ma’am‚ to
see when they will be ready to fetch the
young lady! ‘ Proviso ' is used more than
once in Terence to signify, ‘ I go to see!
Andria v. 5. lz “ Proviso quid agat Pam-
philus.'’ Eunuchus iii. l. 42 “ Huc pro-
viso, ut, ubi tempus siet, deducam.''

3. Hominem maa-imi preti] See note
on Andria v. 2. 143 and for ‘ spectatus’ see
note on Andria i. l. 64. Here ‘spectatus
satis ¹ means ⁴ of weleroved character! '
