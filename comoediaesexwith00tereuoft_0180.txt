on Cicero, In Verrem ii. 2. 36.) This
line presents great difficulty in metre as it
stands. Bentley has turned the line into
an iambic trimeter by striking out the words
⁴ Flos ipse! Lindemann, in his treet-ise ‘ De
Prosodia Plauti‚’ prefixed to his edition of
the Captivi, Miles, and Trinummus, p.
xxxvii, suggests ‘calim' for ‘clam,’ which
makes the verse an iambic tetrameter. But
with all Lindemann’s excellence as an anti-
quarian, one is obliged to distrust his judg-
ment as to forms of words. ‘ Calim ¹ is
mentioned by Forcellini, but he does not
give a single instance of it. It is certainly
remarkable that neither Donatus nor Eu-
graphius notice the words ¹ Flos ipse! Reiu-
hardt interpolates ‘nunc' before ⁴ mihi.r
The line will not scau certainly as it stands,
and we must be content to leave it. If any
emendation is allowable, Ι am for repeat-
ing ‘ tu ' before ⁴ clam,' as suitable to the
emphasis of the line. Compare Horace,
Carm. i. 9. 15 ε

Nec dulces amores
Sperne puer, neque tu choreas,''

and Catullus lxviii. 21 ε “Tu mea tu mo-
riens fregisti commoda, frater.’' An objec-
tion may be made that the words ‘vel vi vel
clam vel precario ’ are quoted from a legal
form, and must therefore be preserved en-
tire3 but we see from Horace, Epist. ii. 2.

that there were other forms of allusion to
the same phraseology3 nor is technical pre-
cision much in keeping with the excitement
of Chaerea. Below, v. 8. 25: ‘⁴ Perfice hoc

35

precibus pretio‚” we have another trace of
the same phrase.

32. Cui mayio bonae Felicitates omnes
adversae sient] ⁴ Felicitas’ is here used in
a neutral sense, as ‘luck,’ as we speak of
¹ good luck ’ and ⁴ bad luck.' chaerea says,
‘ Good luck has never been my friend! In
the same manner ⁴ valetudo ’ pasees into a
bad sense. Bentley proposes ⁴ aversae,’ com-
paring the phrase ⁴ Dii aversi,' in which case
‘ felicitas ' retains its meaning of ¹ good
fortune! But there is no necessity for the
alteration.

Bentley urges the same view. He says,
“ Nam Parmeno, qui totam hanc fervidi
adolescentis orationem tepidus et lentus
audiit, non debet repente ab illo more de-
flectere.'' It is hard to see why Parmeno's

draw out Chaerea’s story step by step ; and
such an exclamation is quite natural after
the preceding speech of Chaerea. ‘ Scelus ¹
is here used in the sense of ‘ infortunium‚'
as Bentley remarks, quoting Plautus, Cap-
tivi iii. 5. 104:

‘⁴ —— Quod hoc est scelus l
Quasi in orbitatem liberos produxe-imp

Bosscha on⁴ that passage (quoted by Linde-
mann) properly notices that ‘ scelus ‘ is not
simply ‘ misfortune,’ but implies anotion of
⁴ fault,' comparing Virgil, Aen. vii. 307:
“Quod scelus aut Lapithas tantum, aut
Calydona merentem ?'' Compare Aen. ii.
229. The fact of a perpetual run of bad
luck could be accounted for on Greek
principles only by the supposition of a
νέμεσις for some previous fault.
