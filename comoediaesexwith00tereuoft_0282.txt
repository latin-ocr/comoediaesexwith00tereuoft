Aer IV. Scimn Ι. Sostrata, wife of
- Chremes, comes on the stage in great ex-
citement, holding in her hand a ring which
she fancies to be the same as that with
which she formerly exposed her daughter:
a conjecture in which the family nurse
agrees. She proceeds to break this piece
of news to her husband, beginning of course
by excusing herself. For when this child
was born, Chremes had ordered it to be ex-
posed, and it had· been given to an old
Corinthiun woman for that purpose. At
the same time, from a superstitious feeling,
she had given the woman a ring to place
with the child. This person had brought up
the child; aud the ring had been found in
the possession of the young woman whom

Bacchis had brought with her. These
tidings are not very grateful to Chremes at
first3 but after having heard the whole story,
he makes up his mind to take*things 00 he

finds them3 and goes with his wife to see
Antiphila.

The Metre is as follows; 1-9‚ iambic
tetrameter-3 10- 54, trochaic tetrameter.

l. Annulus] This ring had been placed
on the person of the child to secure her
recognition in case of preservation, and also
as Sostrata says afterwards, in 0000 of
death, that she might not be without some-
thing belonging to her parents. It was
one of the ⁴ crepundia' or ‘ monumenta’
which would be attached to her clothes or
person. See notes on Eun. iv. 6. 15.
