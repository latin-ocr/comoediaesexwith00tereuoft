3. Maym'fica verba] ‘I 0011 put up with
his folly and his braggart speeches as long
as they are mere words; but if they come
to deeds he shall smart for it.’ The same
expression is used by Plautus, Curculio iv.
4. 23 : “ Tua magnifica verba . . . istas tuas
magnas minas ;'' and by Tibullus, ii. 6. ll,
in a rather different sense, of a lover who

makes violent protestations of indifference
to his mistress :

“ Magna loquor ς sed magnifice mihi magna
Exlgffizzt clausae fortia verba fores.''

5. O mi Chreme, te ipsum exspectabam]
Bentley objects to the word ‘ exspectabam‚'
because Thais could hardly say that she
had been waiting for Chremes, for she had
left him with Thraso when she came away:
and he prefers ‘ expeto,' which also makes
the verse 0 tetrameter trochaic catalectic,
more suitable, as he thinks, to the temper
of Thais at this moment : “Thais quae ante
et post in tetrametris plenis debacchatur,
in hoc versu, viso Chremete, ubi defervet
paulum ira, catalectico utitur.” Ι do not

think that any good editor has been con-
vinced by this reasoning. ‘ Exspectabam' is
perfectly natural. She would say, ⁴ My dem·
Chremes, you are the very person 1 was
looking for,' whether she had left him be·
hind or not.

12. Et hahetur et refer-eim· . . . qratia]
‘ Your kindness is both felt and shall be
repaid, as you deserve, Thais! For this
common distinction between ‘habere’ and
¹ referre gratiam ’ see Cicero, De Officiis ii.
20: “Nimirum enim inops ille, si bonus
est vir, etiam si referre gratiam non potest,
habere certe potest.'’

15. Cistellam . . . effer cum monumentis]
‘Bring out of the house the trinket-box
with her birth-tokens.’ The ¹ monumenta’
are the triukets which were placed upon
children when they were exposed, that they
might be a means of identifying them if
they should grow up. It would seem from
this story of Pamphila that all children had
them. They are more commonly called
‘ crepundia.' They were generally kept in
0 small easket. We have allusione to them
in Plautus. The play called Cistellaria
