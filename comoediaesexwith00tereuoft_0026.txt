“ —— Eas fabulas factas prius
Latina-s scisse sese id vero pernegat.”

(vv. 33, 34.)

The second accusation against Terence is, that he was indebted to his
noble friends for the plays which he produced as his own. This charge Ξ
is mentioned by Cicero: “ Secutus sum, non dico Caecilium (malus

 

enim auctor Latinitatis est), sed Terentium, cujus fabellae propter ele· *s

gantiam sermonis putabantur a O. Laelio scribi” (Ad Atticum vii. 3),

and by Quintilian: “In comoedia maxime claudicamus. Licet Terentii Ἰ

scripta ad Scipionem Africanum referantur3 quae tamen sunt in hoc
genere elegantissima'’ (x. 1. 100). In the life of Terence, ascribed to
Suetonius (or Donatus), Q. Memmius is quoted as saying, “ Pub. Afri-
canus, qui, a Terentio personam mutuatus, quae domi luserat ipse no-
mine illius in scenam detulit.” The same writer mentions on the

authority of Nepos, that G. Laelius being at his villa near Puteoli, on Α
the calends of March, was requested by his wife to come to supper “

sooner than was his custom, for that day was the feast ‘ Matronalia,' on
which the ladies were allowed to rule supreme in their households. In
reply he begged to be excused, as he was busily engaged ; and on entering
the supper-room at a later hour, he declared that he hadnever in his
life been so well satisfied with his writings3 and when they asked him'
to let them hear what he had written, he 'repeated the lines of the
‘ Heautontimorumenos,' commencing

“ Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt.”
(Act. IV. Scene iv. v. 1.)

This story Nepos gives upon what he calls certain information. We must
observe that Cicero and Quintilian both mention the report merely as one
of hearsay3 and Santra, a writer of the age of Julius Caesar, commenting
on the story, remarks that it is not probable that Terence would have
been indebted to men of the age of Scipio and Laelius, for they were
both young at that‘time‚ but rather to Q. Fabius Labeo or O. Sulpicius
Gallus, or distinguished men of their age, of whom he might more justly

have Sffld' ⁴⁴ Qui vobis universis et populo placent3

Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio,
Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.'’
(Adelphi, Prolog. vv. 19—21.)
