father ?' For ‘ somnium ' see note on
{ildlelp2hi iii. 3. 41. For ‘ utine ' see Hecyra

“Utine omnes mulieres eadem aeque stu-
deant, nolintque omnia,’'

and i. 1. 9: “Utine eximium neminem
habeam?⁷' Bentley would read ‘ utne’
here, as he would also in Hecyra ii. 1. 23
but see note there.

37. Atque hercle eqo . . . fabulam] In
all the old editions this line is attributed to
Phormi03 but Bentley, on the authority of
the ¹ Codex Academicus,' gives it to Anti-
pho. In this he is followed by Zeune, who
remarks that in Phormio’s mouth it would
beat vai-ianoe with what he had said pre-
viously; and again, that Geta’s language
immediately afterwards shows that it was
Antipho who spoke here.

40. Ait uterque . . . se dare] This is the
text of the best manuscripts and editions,
except the Bembine, which has ‘ejus ad-
hibendae dari! Bentley conjectures ‘ejus
habendi se dare,’ referring to Hecyra iii. 3.
12. See note there, and on i. 3. 24 of this
play. But there is no necessity for any
change here; and ‘ habendi' in this pas-
sage has no authority whatever.

42. Quin erqo rape me] ‘Away with
me then as quick as y‘ou like! Madame
Dacier supposes that Antipho here jumps
on Geta's back and is carried off ; as a kind
of stage trick. The idea does not seem

very likely, and has been combated by
several editors. ⁴ Rape ' would not be used
in that sense. Zeune aptly compares Eu-
nuchus ii. 3. 85: ‘⁴ Abduc, duc, quantum
potes!

have ended this scene with this lin03 Guy-
etus ends the play here, changing ‘gaudeo'
into ‘ plaudite.’ His opinion has no sup-
port: and we can see no good reason for
rejecting the remainder of the play. The
notion that Phormio should have a scene to
himself because he is left on the stage alone
is due originally to Faern, and is adopted
by Bentley. But as Zeune well remarks, ’
Why should we make this a separate soene,
and not do the same in many other cases
where one of the characters is' lest on the

stage alone? And why commence the
scene, as Bentley does, with the words
⁴ tantam fortunam,’ rather than at ‘ bene,
ita me Di ament, factum ?’ 1 have accord-
ingly kept the arrangement of the old edi-
tions· It is true that in some cases tho
remaining character has a separate soene,
as in Heaut. ii. l, Adelphi iii. 5, and Hecyra
ii. 3, but the rule is by no means nnisorm ς
and many instances quoted by commenta-
tors are not at all to the point.

way to compel them to do this! The old
editions have ‘his datum erit ;' but the
