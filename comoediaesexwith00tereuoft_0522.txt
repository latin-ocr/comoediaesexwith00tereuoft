26. Ο lepidum J] The Bembine manu· accordance to analogy that the oblique cases

script omits ⁴ caput‚’ which appears in the
common text. It is more likely to have
been added than to have been omitted de-
signedly. After ver. 27 there is a line
added: “ ΡΙι. Abi: die praesto ut sit
domi,’' which is not found in the Bembine
and Victorian manuscripts, and is incon-
sistent with what follows3 for Phaedria ac-
companies Geta to Phormio's house.

29. Solus est homo amico amicus] Do-
natus quotes from Apollodorus the line,
μόνος ἐπὶσταται φιλεῖν τοὺς φίλους, which

33. Dicam in itinere] Bentley proposes
‘ dicam in itere‚’ as he does also in Heaut.
ii. 3. 303 but in neither place on any
authority beyond his own. The form ⁴ itere'

among extant classical‘authors. In some,
where it is supposed to be found, the read-

conti-acted form of ‘ itiner ;' and is most in

should follow the original form.

Acr IV. Semu- Ι. Chremes and De-
mipho come on the scene together, talking
of the voyage which the former has just
made to Lemnos. It appears now that
Chremes had gone to Lemnos to bring·
home his daughter, and that she was to
have been married to Antipho, his nephew.
But when he reached Lemnos he found
that she and her mother had started for
Athens, to look for him, and the captain of
the ship in which they had sailed had told
him of their safe arrival. So he had re-
turned home as soon as he could. And
now this business of Antipho’s had deranged
all their plans; sor he does not like to give
his daughter to any stranger. In that case
he would have to make all kinds of explana-
tions, and to tell him the whole story; aud
then he would be at the mercy of his son-
in-law. If they happened to disagree the
whole story would come out, and reach the
