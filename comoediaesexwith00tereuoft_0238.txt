his unintelligible conduct in working himself to death instead of super-
intending his slaves, and Menedemus explaining his reasons by an
account of what led to his son’s departure, and his consequent deter-
mination to punish himself till his return. Chremes being unable to
shake his friend’s determination, returns to keep the festival of Bacchus
at his own house. There he finds the party assembled, and what with
Bacchis and the young men they make a pretty night of it, nearly
emptying his cellar, and turning the house upside down. Early next
morning Chremes, who has a strong head sor an old man, goes to meet
his friend Menedemus as he comes out to his work, and informs him *of
his son‘s return. He advises him to be cautious in receiving him, tells
him what sort of a life he has to expect, and recommends him to do any
thing rather than openly encourage his son in such debauchery. Mene-
demus begs him to do any thing he can to bring about a reunion with
h‘is son, even if it be to encourage the young man and Syrus to cheat
him in any imaginable way. Chremes enters into the plan: and encou-
rages Syrus to devise some scheme for making Menedemus supply
Clinia with the means of indulgence. Syrus has already some such
scheme on foot3 but it is to be directed against Chremes, for he has
promised Bacchis ten minae for her share in the night’s amusements, and
intends to get it out of his master. So he at once explains to his
master a plausible scheme that he has, namely, to induce Menedemus
to buy Antiphila from Bacchis, to whom she has been left in pawn by
Philtere, on the representation that she is a captive from Caria whom
her friends are sure to ransom very handsomely. Meanwhile Sostrata
has discovered, through the medium of the aforesaid ring, that Antiphila
is her own daughter. This disconcerts Syrus, who now springs a new
mine; he sends Bacchis off to Menedemus' house, and explains to
Chremes that the only way to deceive Menedemus now, is to pretend
that she is Clitipho’s mistress, and at the same time to get Clinia to
profess an attachment to Antiphila, and desire his father to demand her
in marriage, for then the old man would have to supply him with money
for the marriage, which of course would go to his mistress Bacchis. At

“ the same time Chremes is persuaded to release his daughter from her

pledge to Bacchis ; and the money is given to Clitipho to carry to Bacchis

for the purpose forsooth of more fully persuading Menedemus that she Ἰ

is his mistress. At this point the denoueinent takes place. Clitipho

acts his part of Bacchis’ lover a little too well, and all the circumstances ι
are discovered by Menedemus„ who proceeds to inform Chremes of the = l

real state of the case. Now the two old men change places, Chremes is ¹
enraged beyond measure at having been made the dupe of his dissolute ’
