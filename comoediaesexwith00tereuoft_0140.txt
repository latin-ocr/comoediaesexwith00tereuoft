Oh. Satis jam satis Simo spectata erga te amicitia est mea:

Acr V. Somni Ι. Chremes, having over-
heard the altercation between Davus and
Mysis, is determined not to marry his
daughter to Pamphilus. Simo has been
repeating his entreaties and arguments
when they come on the stage, and this scene
is nothing more than a continuation of
their previous conversation. Simo claims
the persor-mance of Chremes’ promise, and
explains all that has happened 88 811 arti-
fice of Glycerium’s party to prevent the
marriage. Chremes on the other hand
declines to throw away his daughter, and
maintains that he has already sufficiently
shown his good-will, but cannot any longer
oblige his friend.

The Metre is trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectio.

1. Spectata] See note on i. l. 64.

3. Paene illusi vitam filiae] ‘I have
almost fooled away my daughter’s life.'
In Tacitus we find ‘illudo ' used with a
dative in the same sense. “ Etiam quae
natura denegavisset, per artem tentare et
μ viribus Principis illudere? Ann. xv. 42.
“ Ipse sola perdendi cura stabula aurigis
extruere: circum gladiatorum ferarumque
spectaculis opplere: tanquam in summa
abundantia pecuniae illudere,’' Hist. ii.
94. ‘Vita’ is used in 8 kind of mixed
sense as with us for the ‘ vivendi causaess
happiness, &c. 8ο 111 Adelphi iii. 2. 42;
Heaut. ii. 3. 74.

4. Jmo enim] An elliptical expres-
sion. Chremes implies ‘ I will not yet
08888, for I demand of you more than
ever now to prove in action the kindness
which you 111-01888811,ι 111 words! The phrase

‘imoenim 81 scias ’.occursEun 11. 3. 63.

Quum maxime] See Hecyra 1. 2. 40:

“Hanc Bacchidem amabat, ut quum max-
imi tum Pamphilus.’' Heaut. iv. 5. 40:
“ Quum maxime volo te dare operam.''

6. Vide quam iniquus sis prae studio]
‘ See how unfair you are from your sager·
ness.' ‘ Prae ’ generally expresses the pre-
ventive cause. (See Madvig, Latin Gram-
11181,255,0118. ti.) In Teregiice it is gene-
rally used with a negative phrase as in
Heaut. ii. 3. 67· ‘Prae gaudipo, ita 1118 Di
ament ubi sim nescio; ” v. 1. 47· . “Prae
iracundia non sum apud me.'’ And in the
other passages when it is used, there is 8
negative idea implied under the affirmative

form. Τ11118 111 the text, ‘ You see that ·

your eagerness prevents your being fair3'
and even in Eunuchus i. 2. 18: “Misera
prae amore exclusti hunc foras,” ‘ exclusti '
may have the pregnant sense of ‘ non admi-
sisti.' We find it sometimes in sentences
where there is no idea of negation, as in
Plautus, Rudens i. 2. 85: ‘⁴ Ut prae timore
in genua in undas concidit;'' and ii. 6. 422
‘⁴ Equidem me ad velitationem exerceo,
Nam omnia corusca prae timore fabulor-N
See other instances quoted by Forcellini,
who gives a general explanation of this use
of the word: “Saepe causam significat et
ejus causae abundantiam seu magnitudinem
notat,’ ’which' 18 true as far as it 3088, but

not sufficient. The general idea is prion‘ty, - .. 2

not necessarily implying prevention, though
preventiou necessarily implies priority.

8. Remittas] So Horace, Carm. ii. 11.
3: “ Remittas quaerere.'' Sallust, ι1113111·-
tha 53. “ ‘Neque remittit explorare. ” ¹ In-
juriis,' ‘with wrongs. ' In the following

lines he goes on to specify the nature of
these wrongs.
