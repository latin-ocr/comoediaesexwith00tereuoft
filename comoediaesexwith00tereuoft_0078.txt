4 INTRODUCTION TO ANDRIA.

commences, Simo determines to tell Pamphilus that heis to be married
to Philumena, hoping to place him in a dilemma3 for if he refused, then
he could take him severely to task ; if· he consented, then Chremes might
be gained over, and after all the match might take place. Accordingly
he tells Pamphilus by the way in the Forum that he is to be married
that very day. Pamphilus returns home in amazement3 but is met by
Mysis, servant of Glycerium, who revives his old affection for her mistress·
Davus meanwhile sifts the whole matter to the bottom3 finds that the
marriage is a pretence, and accordingly recommends Pamphilus to humour
his father to the utmost, and express 1116 entire readiness to marry
as soon as 116 pleases. At the same time 116 16 to keep up his intimacy
with Glycerium, that Chremes may be as shy of his connexion as he is
now. Meanwhile there is a by-plot at work. One Charinus, a friend
of Pamphilus, who is in love with Philumena, hears with dismay that
she is to 116 married to his friend, and urges him to do all 111 1116 power
to defer the marriage if possible. So affairs stand when Glycerium is
brought to bed of a son, Simo, who hears what is going on, imagining, and
being confirmed by Davus in the belief, that this is merely an artifice
of Glycerium and her friends to prevent Pamphilus’ marriage. He
accordingly again treats with Chremes on the subject of the marriage
of Pamphilus and Philumena, and extorts 6 reluctant consent. This
places Davus in a great strait3 for Pamphilus now reproaches him
with his untoward advice, which has got him into this mischief3 and
Charinus too is indignant to the last degree at the treachery of Pam-
philus. As a last resource Davus places the child before Simo's door,
and contrives that Chremes shall hear its history from Mysis. This
causes a fresh rupture between Chremes and Simo. At this moment

 

there arrives a native of Andros, Crito, next of kin 10 Chrysis, who 4

has come to Athens to claim her property. He clears up the previous
history of Glycerium, who is joyfully recognized as Chremes’ daughter,
and all parties are made happy; Simo being with some difficulty gained

over to forgive past offences, and to receive his son and Davus into favour
agam.
