some curicus instances in his note on the
omens from ‘mice' and ‘weasels.' The
weasel is mentioned by Plautus, Stichus iii.
2. 7. This ⁴ canis’ occurs in Plautus,
Casina v. 4. ll z “ Caninam scaevam spero
- meliorem fore.'' Horace gives a list of
bad omens which might stop a journey
and make a day's work uulucky:

‘¹ Impios parrae recinentis omen
Ducat, et praegnans canis, aut ab agro
Rava decurrens lupa Lanuvino,
Foetaque vulpes.
Rumpat et serpens iter institutum.”
(carm. iii. 27. l -5.)

The fact of a strange dog coming into one's
house was reckoned of importance. Sueto-
nius says in his life of Vespasian (cap. 5):
‘⁴ Prandente eo quondam canis extrarius e
trivio manum humanam intulit, mensaeque
subjecit;'’ where it may be remarked that
‘ extrarius ' answers to ⁴ alienus.' See note
on iv. 1. 13.

26. Anquis per impluvium] The same
thing is mentioned by Plautus, Amphitruo
v. l. 56, in the story of the infant Hercules:

“Devolant angues jubati deorsum in im-
pluvium duo
Maximi.”

From which passage Bentley argues that we
ought here to read ¹ in impluvium.' But is
⁸ per impluvium ¹ is wrong here, Terence
commits the same fault in Eunuchus iii. 5.
41. See the note on that passage.

27. Gallina cecinit] Donatus tells us
that it had been observed that where a hen
crowed, in that house the wife always sur-

vived her husband.

Interdioeit hariolus] The ¹ hariolus ’ was
one who predicted future events under in-
spiration, the ‘haruspex’ divined from in·
spection of the sacrifices. See a sti-ing of
these officials, of the female ¹tribe, mentioned
by Plautus, Miles Gloriosus iii. l. 96, διο.
‘ Haruspex' is derived by Donatus from
‘ haruga ' (see Forcellini, ⁴ Arviga'), but it
is more probably closely connected in ety-
mology with ἱεροσκόπος. ‘Hariolus' he
explains by ‘ fariolus’ from ‘ fari.' He
distinguishes between ‘hariolus‘ and ‘ha-
ruspex.' saying that the former is conoerned
with things relating to men, the latter with
divine things. ‘The diviner forbid 'me to
enter upon any new business before the
winter, which is the most sufficient reason
of all) Bentley has re-written these lines
on a plan of his own ε

“Aruspex vetuit: ante brumam autem
novi

Negoti nihil incipere causa est sontica.”

But ‘sontica causa’ occurs only once in

gxtgpt classical authors. See Tibullus i.
“ Parce, precor, tenero; non illi sontica

causa est;
In veteres esto dura, puella, senes.”

The expression does not occur even in
Plautus, and Bentley has no authority for
introducing it here. Forcellini explains the
word fully3 but it is not to our present
purpose. The words ⁴ quae causa est justis-
sima'¹ express the same general meaning,
and are found in all the manuscripts.
