Π. THE LANGUAGE ANB METREs OF TERENCE.

Oommr naturally approaches much more nearly to common language
than any other kind of poetry. An Epic is made to be read, not spoken ;
Tragedy and Lyric Poetry are raised above the level of ordinary con-
versation; while in Comedy we have a faithful reflexion of every-day life,
manners, and language. And when we come to the Latin language, and
its pronunciation‚ as indicated by the practice of Terence, the value of this
common type of Comedy is heightened by the particular feature which
distinguishes the Roman Comedy‚ the employment of a foreign, and often
a highly artificial‚ metre. These two considerations placed together en-
able us to form a tolerably accurate judgment of the pronunciation of the
Latin language in the time of Terence. For on the one hand we hold it
for certain that wherever it was possible Terence would keep closely to
the pronunciation, as well as to the conversational idiom, of ordinary
language3 and the existence of metre in his plays enables us in most cases
to ascertain clearly what was the pronunciation of any particular word.
To take an example. If we find that ‘maela’ with perhaps one or two
exceptions (see note on Hecyra v. 3. 32), is pronounced as a mono-
syllable, while ‘ modo ’ (abl.) is inyariably a dissyllable (and this can bc
clearly ascertained by the metreff, we' have so far a valuable hint for the
etymological use of these two words. And in the same way a careful
attention to the metre as well as to the sense will often enable us to
break through some supposed law of grammarians, which was made
without sufficient attention to these points. (See the instance of ‘ statim‚'
note on Phormio v. 3. 6.) And as the metre thus helps the pronuncia-
tion‚ so the pronunciation reacts on the metre. When we carry with us
to the Metres of Terence a clear estimate of the then existing Roman
pronunciation, we are able to disentangle his verses of many of the per-
plexities which commentators have often introduced into them. The
student who understands that in ordinary pronunciation such a word as
‘habent’ was monosyllabic will not be reduced to the necessity of be-
lieving, with Bentley, that in the line '

“ Habent despicatam et quae nos semper omnibus cruciant modis‚'’.
(Eun. ii. 3. 92,)
