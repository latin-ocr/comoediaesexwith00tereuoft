AOTUS TERTII SOENA PRIMA.

MENEDEMUS.

Oh. Luciscit hoc jam : cesso pultare ostium

Vicini, primum ex me ut sciat sibi filium

Redisse Ρ etsi adolescentem hoc nolle intelligo.

Verum quum videam miserum hunc tam excruciarier ἰ

Ejus abitu, celem tam insperatum gaudium, 5
Cum illi pericli nihil ex indicio siet P

Haud faciam: nam, quod potero, adjutabo senem3

Ita ut filium meum amico atque aequali suo

Video inservire, et socium esse in negotiis ;

Nos quoque senes est aequum senibus obsequi.

Aer 111. δον-,ΝΕ I. A night has now
passed since the last Act, and meanwhile
Chremes has had the pleasure of entertain-
ing his son's friend and his mistress and
all her followers at his house. He now
comes from his house to tell Menedemus
the J'oyful news of his son’s return, as it is
meet that one friend should do his best to
help another, and alleviato his distress if
possible. He finds Menedemus in a de-
sponding mood; and immediately breaks
his errand to him. The old man is for
flying to his son at once, but Chremes re-
strains him, and explains that it will not be
for his son’s good that they should meet
just at present, or that Clinia should know
that his father is ready to sacrifice every
thing for him. To enforce his advice he
gives his friend an account of the late
doings at his house; what a mistress this is
that Clinia has got, what enormous expense
she is likely to entail upon him. If he is

³ determined to indulge him, he advises him

at all events not to do it openly. He had
better allow himself to be cheated by his
slave and his son, than once let his son see
that he may have his own way in every
thing. For then it will be the old story
over again ς and then if, after all he refuses
his son any thing, the young fellow will
know which is his best game. He will
threaten to enlist again, and gain his point.
Menedemus is partially convinced by these
arguments, and only wonders that his
friend should understand his affairs so
much better than he does himself. So they
part, Chremes undet-taking to bring about
a speedy meeting between the father and

the son. ,

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

Scaliger and Madame Dacier are of opi-
nion that this Play was exhibited in two
distinct parts z—the first two acts in the
evening after sunset, and the remainder
next morning at fdaybreak: What value
there may be in such an hypothesis has
been discussed in the Introduction to this
Play, p. 165.

break.’ Forcellini considers that ‘ hoc’
here is used δεικτικῶς, as if the speaker

‘ lt is just day-

pointed at the heavens. We find the same , ’

phrase in Plautus, Amphitruo i. 3. 45.
{fgef-etius uses ‘ Hoc ’ absolutely for the

‘⁶ Denique jam tuere hoc circum supraque
quod omnem

Continet amplexu terram.'’ v. 318.

But we find the verb used impersonally
in Plautus, Amph. i. 3. 35: “Tempus
est: exire ex urbe priusquam luciseat
volo,’' and Livy iv. 28: “ Et jam luoee-
cebat, omniaque sub oculis erant.'' and'it
is more natural to consider ‘ hoc ’ as part of
the impersonal expression, which is gene-
rally suppressed in Latin, but is expressed
in most languages. So we say ‘This is
very dark.’ ⁴ It is light ς’ and we' may com-
pare the German ⁸ es tagt,' and French
‘il fait jour.' ‘ Lucet hoc ' is similarly used
in Plautus, Miles Gloriosus ii. 2. 64. For

ii. 2. 6, and iv. l. 58.
