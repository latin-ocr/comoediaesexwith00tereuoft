both Donatus and Engrapbius notice that Terence uses the Roman
name, while Menander had expressly mentioned Ἄρτεμις. See the note

on the passage.

'I'be ‘ Perinthia’ of Menander furnishes us with two fragments only
capable of being identified with Terence’s play. The first scene, as has
been already obsened, was transferred nearly word for word to the
‘Andria’ by Terence. The following passages may be compared with
parts of the Latin play:

οὐδεμίαν ἡ γραῦς ὅλως
κύλικα παρῆκεν ἀλλὰ πίνει τὴν κύκλῳ,
(Fragm. Πφινθ. V.)

which seems most probably to belong to the description of ‘ Lesbia’ the
‘obmtrixss Compare

“Audivi Archylis jamdudum. Lesbiam adduci jubes.
Sane pol illa temulenta est mulier et temeraria,’'
(And. i. 4. 1, 2 ,)

τὸ παιδίον δ’ εἰσ-ἢλθεν ἑψητοὺς φέρον, (vi.)
of which we probably find an imitation in

and

 

Etiam puerum inde abiens conveni Chremi
Olera et pisciculos minutos serre obolo in coenam seni‚”

(And. ii. 2. 31, aa)

whatever may be the true reading of this difficult line. See the note.
Besides these passages, which can be traced to one or other of the

acknowledged prototypes of the ‘ Andri& there are two others which ἱ

seem to have been imitated by Terence in that play:

Ἐγώ α’ ἔθηκα δοῦλον ὅντ’ ἐλεύθερον.
(Mainake, Fragm. Comic. Anonym. xiii.)

'l'his is quoted by Aristotle, Soph„ Elench. 4, as an instance of an
ambiguous sentence. We may compare

‘Feci e servo ut esses libertus mihi,”
(And. i. 1. 10,)

though there seems good reason for hesitating to refer the fragment to
the ‘ Andria ' of Menander. See Meineke as quoted above.
Finally, we are infor-med by Donatus on Andria v. 5. 32

‘⁸ Ego Deorum vitam propterea sempiternam esse arbitror
Quod voluptates eorum propriae suntg nam mibi immortalitas
Parta nt si nulla aegritudo huic gaudio intercesserit?
