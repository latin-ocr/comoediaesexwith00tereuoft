always claim the liberty of making any innovation that they chose on
ordinary customs.

Bentley, indeed, justly derides the excessive mania> for ‘ Licences ’ in
the following words: “Nimirum hi non ipsos Poetas, non artem et
rhythmi genium, sed librarios sibi duces sumunt; et tot fere licentiarum
species sibi fingunt quot in toto Plauto Terentioque vitiosae lectiones
nunc restant; unique loco, qui emendandus erat, ex altero aeque men-
doso patrocinium quaerunt.” At the same time he falls into the error
of treating words contracted by common pronunciation, such as studet,
soror, simul, and many others, as if they were shortened in spite of their
position. For examples I may refer the reader to the list of passages
in his Σχεδίασμα; οΠ of which are to be explained by ‘ Synizesis,’ or
‘ Synaloepha.’ Bitschl’s views, and Lindemann's, are in the main more
sound3 but they both occasionally mix metrical considerations wit-h the
subject of language; and Bitschl, though he seems to consider that all
such words as those which we have considered are most properly to be
referred to contraction, yet throughout his chapter on this head he
speaks of the words as ‘ having the first, or second, syllable short.’ His
treatise ia, however, exceedingly valuable‚ even in spite of his great love
of emendation, which, with him as with his great predecessor, Bentley,
too frequently spoils what he wishes to improve ⁹.

Mmmon, Accam.

We have already seen that the comio poet had to preserve a just .
balance between the common pronunciation of language and the metrical
accent. In other words, the foundation of metre was the quantity
combined with the observance of the accent as far as possible¹. In
the ordinary pronunciation of Latin the necent never fell on the last
syllable of any word ².

⁰ An editor may fairly in a note use the ordinary language of mette to illustrate any
peculiarity of a line. He may say, This cannot be a dactyl in place of a trochee, where
these words save him 0 long explanation. Accordingly, to express my meaning briefly, 1
have ocoasionally used such terms in my notes; and have spoken of syllables being
ohortened, &o. where the more accurate expression would have been that the word was
mummi in pronunciation. But in 011 express discussion of the subject of metro and
pronunciation the editor should be eareful not to confound the two subjecte. The metro
οἱ Terence is discussed in its place.
