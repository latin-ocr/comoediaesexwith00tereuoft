ῙΝἭΒΟΒΠΟΤΙΟΝ.

'l'ms play derives its name from the two pairs of brothers who are
introduced. Demea and Micio, the eldere, had always been very dis-
similar in character and manner of life. Micio was a pleasant old
bachelon and had always lived in town, and was very lenient and
indulgent towards his young' relations. Demea on the contrary had
kept up the thrifty habits of his early years, residing on his farm and
taking a severe view of the conduct of his sons. Ctesipho, the younger
of his sons, lived with his father at this farm; but Aeschinus, the elder,
had been adopted by his uncle. They had accordingly been very differ·
ently brought up. Ctesipho had been kept very strictly at home, and
was, to the best of his father’s belief, a model of propriety. Aeschinus
had been indulged by his uncle in every way, till he was notorious for
his dissipation. He went so sar at last as to offer violence to a young
lady named Pamphila, whom he met one night when he was intoxicated.
'l'his was the last of his excesses. He promised to,make all amends
in his power by marrying Pamphila, and on this condition the matter
was kept quiet by Sostrata her mother. Ctesipho in one of his
visits to the town had fallen in love with a music girl belonging to a
slave-merchant, and was carrying on an intercourse with her under the
cover of his brother’s uame3 for Aeschinus had taken the credit of the
affair to himself that his father might not hear of Ctesipho's doings.
Aster s time the slave-merchant gave notice¹ to Ctesipho that unless he
bought the music girl at his price she should be immediately sold.
Ctesipho was iu the greatest despair at this announcement, and was
halfinclined to run away from his troubles and leave the country, when
Aeschinus, hearing the state of the case, cut matters short by breaking
into the house of Sannio the slave-merchant, maltreating him, and carry·

Α ing off the girl to his own house, where she was received by Ctesipho.

Here the action of the play commences. Demea coming into town
hears of this new outrage of Aeschinus’, and accuses bis brother Micio
os being the cause of all this excess. It was his indulgence that bsd
made· Aeschinus so dissoluto: How different was the conduct of his
