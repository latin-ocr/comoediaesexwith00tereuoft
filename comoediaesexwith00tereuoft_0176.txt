mancipi' was a term designating things
capable of Quiritarian ownership, which
could be transferred only by ⁴mancipatio,’
or the formal sale ‘per aes et libram!
Hence the same word ‘mancipium ’ was
used to designate property acquir-ed by this
mode of transfer, and was often applied, as
in the present instance, to ⁴ slaves,' as belong-
ing to the class of ‘ Res mancipi! See the
article ⁴ Mancipium ' in the Dictionary of
Antiquities. Compare Horace, Sat. ii. 7. 3:

Davusne? Ita, Davus, amicum

Mahncipiqm domino et frugi quod sit satis,
oc es

in ii. . .

 

43. Ut salsus animi eall] ⁴ How he is
mistaken in what he thinks !' In Plautus
and Terence ⁴ falsus’ is generally used in
its strict participial sense. Compare Andria
iv. l. 23, note. We find the genitive in a
pagsage of Silius Italicus, speaking of Han-
ni al:

 

post Itala bella

Assyrio famulus regi, falsusque cupiti

Ausoniae motus, dubio petet aequora velo.”
Punica xiii. 885—887.

Compare Lucretius v. 97:

⁴⁴ Nec me animi fallit quam res nova mira-
que menti
Accidat exitium coeli terraeque futurum.”

It is an imitation of the Greek
Compare Sophocles, Trachiniae 712 :
μόνη γὰρ αὑτὸν, εἶ τι μὴ ψευσθὴσομαι
γνώμης, ἐγὼ δύστηνος ἐξαποφθερῶ.

idiom.

And Thucydides, καὶ γὰρ καὶ ἄδεια ἐφαίνετο

δυνάμεως ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον, όση ὕστερον δι-

⁴ Falsus animo ' would ra-
ther mean ‘deceived in his judgment,' as
the Greek ψευσθῆναι γνώμῃ.

47 . Ne sursum deorsum cursitet] ⁴ That
you may not have to keep running to and
fr0.’ Many commentator-s, with their usual
love for the literal, explain this expression
by the remark that Athens was very hilly,
and they refer to Adelp hi' 1v. 2. 35. Other-
wise it would hardly be necessary to remark
that the phrase, like the Greek ἅνω κάτω,
is used rather in a mental than in aphysical
sense, as we talk of going up and down the
street, without any reference to the level of
the ground. So the cognate phrase ⁴ susque
deque ¹ is applied to vacillation or indiffer-
ence of mind. See Plautus, Amphitruo iii.
2. 5: “Atque id me susque deque esse
habituram putat.”

51—53. ] These lines are spoken by
Parmeno as Gnatho enters Thais’ house
with his taunting offer to carry a message
for him. We may conceive some pauses
and a little dumbshow of wrath and antici-
pated triumph before Gnatho returns, aa he
would very shortly. In v. 53 Bentley reads
⁴ forem,’ but unnecessarily. ‘'Fores is ω be
pronounced as a monosyllable here and in
other passages. For the use of ‘mihi’
compare Phormio v. 9. 21 ι “ Qui mihi ubi
ad uxores ventum est tum fiunt senes.” Like
the Greek μοι, it is often redundant. Here
it expresses Gnatho’s triumph over Par-
meno. When Gnatho returns, he finds
Parmeno where he left him. ⁴ Are you
still on guard,' he says3 ⁴ that no go—between
from the soldier may pass to her?' The
word‘ internuntiusf it need not be said, is

as common as the thing. It occurs again
in Heaut. ii. 3. 58. v

εφᾱνη, iv. 108.
