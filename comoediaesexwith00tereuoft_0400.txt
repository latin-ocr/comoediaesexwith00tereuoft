does not last long. Philumena, finding that she has no hope of con-
cealing her situation from her mother-in-law‚ begins to avoid her, and to
withdraw from her company as much as possible; till, at last, she goes
to her own mother on the pretence of attending a family sacrifice, and
stays with her, refusing to return to her mother-in-law. Sostrata sends
for her, but in vain; and she goes to see her, but is refused admit-
tance. .

This brings us to the beginning of the Second Act of the play, where
the action really commences3 for all that we had hitherto is merely a ‘
kind of prologue. Laches, Pamphilus’ father, has now heard of this
estrangement between his wife and his daughter-in-law, and comes into
town to look into the matter. Priding himself much upon his wonder-

· ful knowledge of every thing that is going on, he lays it down decidedly

that Sostrata alone is to blame; that all mothers·in-law hate their
daughters-in-law, and that she must have driven Philumena away by her
unkindness3 and he is more confirmed in his opinion by the statement
of Phidippus that his daughter refuses to come back to Laches’ house
while her husband is away. Sostrata in vain endeavours to clear her-
self. .

At this moment Philumena’s expected child is born; and Pamphilus
returns home at the critical moment. Hearing that his wife is ill, he
rushes into the house to see her, and there discovers the whole state of
the case. Myrrhina entreats him to keep the matter quiet, and he so
far retains his affection for his wife that he promises to do so, and is
wretched at the thoughts of a separation from her, though he comes to
the conclusion that after this child’s birth, the son of he does not know
whom, it is impossible for him ever to receive her back into his house.
Meanwhile he sees the necessity of getting rid of his slave Parmeno,
who will otherwise be sure to discover what is going on. So he sends
him off on two ermnds, the last of which keeps him fully employed at a
distance the rest of the day.

The body of the play is occupied by the indignant expostulations of the
two fathers with Pamphilus, and with their wives. Now that Pamphilus
has a son, Laches cannot conceive why he should not take his wife home
again; and Phidippus is furious with him, with Laches, and with
Myrrhina his wife. Sostrata comes to the determination of leaving
town, and going to live with her husband in the country, hoping that
her absence will remove the last obstacle to Philumena’s return; but
notwithstanding this, Pamphilus still persists in his ,refusal to receive
his wife, and at last the old men corne to the conclusion that he must
be still carrying on his old love affair with Bacchis, and determine to
send for her, and to endeavour by fair means or foul to break off her
intimacy with Pamphilus.
