Bentley reads ‘meritu’s,' supplying ι88;’

¹ Immo' will therefore mean, ‘in the lowest but this is not required. Davus may be

degree‚’ ⁴ by no means.' I am indebted
for this explanation to Dr. Donaldson.

different view is taken by Mr. Long (Clas-
sical Museum, vol. iii. p. 291-297), who
derives ‘immo' from ‘in modo.' But is
the phrase ‘in modo’ ever found? and do
we ever meet with the ablative ⁴ modo ' as 8
monosyllable in Terence or Plautus ?

you, you rascal?’ A very common word.
Culprits were made to wear a yoke on their
necks, to which their hands were fastened.
The extreme punishment of slaves was the
cross, which is often alluded to in the comic

sion to the judicial praefice of Athens, which
required the condemned to fix their punish-
ment. Itis more natural to consider the
question and answer more simply as such
as might occur 111 1881 life. Classical
authors are not to be made responsible for
’ 811 the allusions which critics may discover
111 their language. Τι’ παθεῖν φήσεις ᾰὲιος
εἶναις occurs in Aristophanes, Ranae 1044.
Annon dixi esse hoc futurum f] This
position of the words, adopted by Bentley
from MSS„ is far better than ‘hoc esse

supposed to cut Pamphilus short before he
finishes his sentence. In many passages
undoubtedly the ‘ es' has been lost by the
carelessness os transcribers. See note on
Adelphi iii. 3. 40. Ι have endeavoured to
supply it in all such cases.

18. Hoc tempus praecavere mihi me
haud te ulcisci sinit] Bentley reads
⁴ monet,' conceiving ‘ sinit ’ to be discordant.
But many words are used in their natural
sense in one member of a sentence, and in
8 derived sense in another3 and it is some-
times difficult to decide whether the verb
has two meanings, or whether another verb
is to be supplied. ⁶ Haud sinit ' is equivalent
to οὐκ ἑᾷ, which means either ‘ does not
allow‚' or ⁴ allows not to do this, but that!
The passage may be translated ε ⁴ Time
does not allow me to punish you, but only
to take measures for my own safety!

Aer IV. SCENE I. Charinus comes on
the stage full of indignation against Pam-
philus. He accuses him o'f the usual in-
gratitude of mankind. Pamphilus has some
difficulty in persuading him of the real state
of the case; and then Charinus turns upon
Davus, who allows that he is at fault, but
promises that he will extricate Pamphilus
yet from his serape.
