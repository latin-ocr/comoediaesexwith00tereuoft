elders, belongs in this play to Phormio. A similar analysis might be·
extended to every character in Terence. No two are precisely alike.
How different is the Pamphilus of the ‘Andria’ from his namesake of
the ‘ Hecyra 1’ what a marked contrast between Bacchis of the ‘ Heau-
tontimorumenos ' and Bacchis of the ‘Hecyra ;’ between the two pairs
of old men in the ‘ Heautontimorumenos ’ and the ⁶ Adelphi ;’ between
Sostrata and Nausistrata, Pythias and Mysis; between Thais and
others of her class! A close study of Terence will enable any reader to
amplify these remarks to any extent, and to verify for himself what Ι
can here state only briefly, that both in the grouping and in the treat-
ment of his characters Terence is an original as compared with Plautus;
—a comparison too lengthy to be instituted here, even if it were thev
proper place for it. Whether he copied Menander closely we cannot say3
but from the hints that we can glean from scattered fragments of the

Greek comedians, I sor my part am inclined to conclude that he was in ’

a great measure original even when compared with Menander.

Every edition of Terence that I have seen has some curious informa-
tion on the nomenclature of the characters of Terence. Names had, no
doubt, as they now have, their etymology, and certain general observa-
tions respecting them may hold good3 as, for example, the common deri-
vation of the names of slaves, male and female, from the countries from
which slaves were generally obtained ; the names that were in vogue to
distinguish courtezans from women of good position. But we can only
laugh at the commentator, however ancient and respectable, who tells us
that Simo was a name given to an acrimonious and suspicions old
gentleman, because “ Simi fere sunt iracundi,'' or that another old gen-f
tleman, Chremes, derives his name from χρέμπτεσθαι, enixe exspuere,
for “ old men are often troubled with an inveterate cough,’' while
curiously enough the same name is given in another play to a young
man ; why, commentators wisely decline to say. Such investigatione are
to be paralleled only by the pertinacity of the old commentatore on
Horace in giving to every Lydia and Chloe apostrophized by the poet a
local habitation and a history. We have no reason to suppose that.
Terence or any other comic poet went so far in the esoteric application
of their nomenclature. The Drama. has always had its regular reper-
tory of names ae well as of dresses3 and we may as well endeavour to
find a moral in the Guys and Amelias of the modern novel as in a
Pamphilus, aMenedemus,'or a Simo. I have therefore allowed these·
speculatione to rest in the dust in which I found them; and I- hope they«,
