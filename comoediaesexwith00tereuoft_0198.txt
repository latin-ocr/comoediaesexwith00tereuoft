EUNUOHUS.

Quo pacto Danaae misisse aiunt quondam in gremium imbrem

aureum.

Egomet quoque id spectare coepi; et, quia consimilem luserat
J am olim ille ludum, impendio magis animus gaudebat mihi ;
Deum sese in hominem convertisse, atque in alienas tegulas 40
Venisse clanculum per impluvium, fucum factum mulieri.

The walls were often covered with fresco
paintings. See the article ‘ Pictura ' in the
Dictionary of Antiquities. Compare Plautus,
Menaechmei i. 2. 34, 35 :

‘⁴ Dic mihi numqua tu vidisti tabulam pic-
tam in pariete
Ubi aquila Catamitum raperet aut ubi
Venus Adoneum ?''

‚ These paintings seem to have often been of

a licentious character, and sometimes scan-
dalously indecent. Thus Propertius ii. 6.
{gaza complains of their demoralizing

‘⁴ Quae manus obscoenas depinxit prima
tabellas,
Et posuit casta turpia visa domo,
Illa puellarum ingenuos corrupit ocellos,
Nequitiaeque suae noluit esse rudes.
Non istis olim variabant tecta figuris.
Tunc paries nullo crimine pictus erat.”

From which passage it appears that such
paintings were not confined to the houses
of persons of Thais' profession.

This is a convenient place 1ο mention the
discredit into which this play has been
brought by this scene. Not to mention
any inferior authors, St. Augustine has
made this passage the text of a reproach
which he frequently casts upon the heathen,
that the example of their gods was an en-
couragement to crime. ‘⁴ Omnes enim cul-
tores talium deorum‚'’ he says, “ mox ut eos
libido perpulerit, ferventi, ut ait Persius,
tincta veneno, magis intuentur quid Jupiter
fecerit quam quid docuerit Plato, vel censue-
rit Cato,” De Civitate Dei ii. 7. He goes
on to quote this and some of the following
lines. We find it difficult to appreciate the
taste which is not offended at the whole
plot of the Eunuchus; but it may be
safely affirmed that few modern poets would
have treated so difficult a subject so deli.
cately. In this very passage Terence by
his elaborate description of all the attendant
circumstances draws away the attention from
the act itself. We must remember, too, in
judging of the taste of a Roman audience,
that vice was with the heathen world a
matter not of morals‚ but of social con-
venience. Immoralities were branded with
disgrace chiefly when they led to outrages

on citizens, or on the established religion.
We see these matters in so clear a light
that we are apt to forget to calculate the
disturbing effect of the medium through
which they saw them.

Ι may observe that Augustine. quoting
probably from memory, changes the words
a little. In v. 37, he reads ‘in gremium
quondam ;' 42, ⁴ summo sonitu ς’ 43, ⁸ Ego
homuncio id non facerem? Ego vero illud
feci, ac lubens!

39. Impendio mayis emimus¹ yaudebat
mihi] ⁸ My mind exulted the more with a
mischief.' The origin of the phrase is that
we measure the degree by the expense it
puts us to, by its cost. The phrase is not
uncommon. Compare Plautus, Aulularia,
Prolog: “Atque ille vero minus minusque
impendio Curare.'' Cicero, Ad Atticum x.
4. 9: ‘⁸ At ille impendio nunc magis odit
Senatum.'’

41. Venisse clanculum per impluvium]
⁴ Came secretly through the skylight!
Terence here, and again in Phormio iv. 4.
26, ‘⁴ Anguis per impluvium decidit de
tegulis,’' uses ⁴ impluvium ’ where we
should rather have expected ‘compluvium.'
Plautus does the same twice in the Miles
Gloriosus ii. 2. 4. and 18:

‘⁴ Modo nescio quis inspectavit vostrorum
familiarium
Per nostrum impluvium intus apud nos
Philocomasium atque hospitem

Osculantes.''
The ‘impluvium ’ was properly the tank
into which the rain fell, which was in the
middle of the hall. The sloping roof above
was called ‘ compluvium ’ because it 801-
lected the rain which was to fall into the
rank. ‘Impluvium ’ was commonly used
as the general name for the whole. Bentley
gives a most curicus reason for altering this
passage. He says, “ Jupiter si per illud
(impluvium) decidisset, non propior Danaae
cubiculo fuisset quam si foris in via esset.”
He therefore reads “ per pluviam fucum
factum virgini‚” and says, “ Ex nostra emen-
datione imber aureus per tegulas in virginis
cubiculum perfluxit.'' But this is to be
literal to a fault. Terence, too, would hardly
be guilty in two lines of making Jupiter a
shower and a man at once.
