 

INTRODUCTION.

 

PAMPHILA and Chremes were the children of an Athenian citizen.
Pamphila, while an infant, was carried off from her home at Sunium by
robbers, and by them sold to a merchant of Rhodes. He presented her
to a courtesan of that place, who had her brought up with 1161 own
daughter Thais as her younger sister. When Thais grew up she 16-
moved to Athens with a lover of hers, who at his death left her all
his property. She then kept company with a soldier named Thraso,
who went to Caria‘ after living with her a short time. Mean-
while her mother had died, and her uncle wishing to realize money by
Pamphila, who was beautiful and accomplished, sold her to Thraso, who
happened to be at Rhodes on his return to Athens, and carried her with
him intending to make a present of her to Thais. During his absence,
however, Thais had found a new lover, one Phaedria, son of Laches.'
This Thraso discovers on his return, and in order to secure his footing
with her, makes his present conditional upon Phaedria’s dismissal. This
causes Thais great perplexity, for she is really attached to Phaedria, and
yet much wishes to get possession of Pamphila, whose history she has
learnt in part, and whom she hopes to restore to her Athenian family,
intending by so doing to make herself friends in Athens. Accordingly
she shuts her door against Phaedria. He is at first highly incensed at
her conduct; but after an interview with her, consents to absent himself
from Athens sor a day or two, that she may have time to-obtain Pam-
phila from Thraso. Before he goes 116 gives orders that an Ethiopian
slave, and an eunuch whom he has’bought for Thais, shall be taken to
her house. At this moment Thraso sends Pamphila under the escort
of Gnatho his follower. On her way to Thais’ house she is seen in
the street by Chaerea, Phaedria’s brother, who at first sight falls despe-
rately in love with her, and hurries after her, but being detained on his
way by an old friend of his father's‚ arrives just too late to see her taken

' into the house. Here he falls in with Parmeno, his fatlier's slave, and

between them they concoct the scheme on which the plot of the play

turns. Chaerea is dressed up in the eunuch's clothes and conducted to

Thais' house, where he soon has an opportunity of carrying out his in-

⁴ tended scheme, during the absence of Thais at Thraso's house3 after
