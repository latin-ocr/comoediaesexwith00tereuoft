492 TERENCE AND THE NEW COMEDY.

that this whole passage is transferred from the ‘ Eunuchus ’ of Menander.
Compare Terent. Eun. iii. 5. 3, 4. The lines of Menander have not
been preserved.

EUNUCHUS.

The ‘ Eunuchus ' of Terence was taken partly from the ‘ Eunuchus:

ι partly from the ‘ Colax‚’ of Menander, which latter play had apparently

been imitated by Naevius and Plautus before our author. See Prol. ad
Eunuch. notes on vv. 25. 27. In this instance the two plays of Me-
nander must have been altogether different in substance and plot—the
‘ Eunuchus ’ was probably entirely devoted to the plot by which Chaerea
obtains possession of Pamphila, to Phaedria’s love affair with Thais,
and the intervention of Chremes to clear up the mystery hanging about
Pamphila3 with the ludicrous revenge of Pythias and the perplexity of
the outwitted Parmeno. These materials compose the greater portion
of Terence's play, and were, no doubt, the whole of Menander’s. The
character of Antipho was introduced by Terence himself to serve as a soil
to Chaerea. See Donatus on iii. 4. 1. The ‘ Colax ’ would give the‘ cha-
racters of Thraso (or Bias in Menander, see Meineke, ΚΟΛΑΞ i.) and
Gnatho (or Struthias) ; and was particularly devoted to the sketch of the
Braggadocio and the Parasite. Terence introduces these two characters
into the plot of the ‘Eunuchus,’ connecting them with Thais. This
portion of the play consists of Act ii. Scene 23 Act iii. Scenes 1 and 23
Act iv. Scene '7 ; Act v. Scenes '7 and 8: certainly, with the exception
of Chaerea‘s adventures, the most spirited part of the play, and in point

' of humour among the best scenes remaining to us in Latin *Comedy.

The fragments which have been preserved of the ‘Eunuchus’ of
Menander are very few. The most lengthy extract from this play is
found in Persius, Sat. v. 161, Suc„ where* it appears that Chaerestratus,
Chrysis, and Davus were the names of the characters which appear in
Terence as Phaedria, Thais, and Parmeno. This is not a great matter.

The opening words of the play,

«ι Quid igitur faciam ‘1³⁹’ ’ (nun. i. 1. 1,)

-are said by Donatus to be a translation of Menander's εἶτα τί ποιήσω;
and the following words, he remarks, should be read ‘ Ν on eam ne nunc
quidem?' without any break, if we would keep close to Menander’s
original. On this hint Meineke has restored (conjecturally) the frag-
ment thus:

εἶτα τί ποιήσως μὴ προσέλθω μηδὲ νῦν,

αὑτῆς καλούσ-ης; (Εὓν. Fragm. i.) ·
