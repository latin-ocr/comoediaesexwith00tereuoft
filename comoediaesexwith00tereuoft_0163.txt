SOEN A I. 89

Mori me malim: sentiet qui vir siem ;''

Haec verba una mehercle falsa lacrimula,

Quam oculos terendo misere vix vi expresserit,

Restinguet: et te ultro accusabit : et dabis

Ei ultro supplicium. Ph. O indignum facinus! nunc ego et 25
Illam scelestam esse et me miserum sentio ;

Et taedet ; et amore ardeo; et prudens sciens,

Vivus vidensque pereo ; nec quid agam scio.

Pa. Quid agas nisi ut te redimas captum quam queas

Minimo Ρ si nequeas paululo, at quanti queas :
Ph. Itane suades P Pa. Si sapis:

¹ Et ne te afflictas.

30

Neque praeterquam quas ipse amor molestias
Habet addas, et illas quas habet recte feras.
Sed ecca ipsa egreditur nostri fundi calamitas;

Nam quod nos capere oportet haec intercipit.

22. Haec verba una mehercle salsa lacri-
muta] ‘ And yet by heaven with one false
tear which she will have had some difficulty
with sore rubbing to force from her eyes,
she will quench all this valorous talk! The
line is a very awkward one from the want of
caesura in the second foot. Bentley would
read ” Haec verba ea 11118 ;’' but the correc-
tion does more harm than good; for while
it menda the metre, which is awkward as it
stands, ‘ mehercle ' becomes a dissyllable,
contrary to general usage. 1 should prefer
“ Verba 11880 meherclee una falsa lacrimula:”
sor although the form ’ mehercles ⁹ does not
000111· except 111 Cicero, Pro Plancio xxvi..

et it is the more natural ,ν for ⁵ mehercles’

811 abbreviation of ⁸ me hercles amet‚' or
⁸ its me hercles amabit,’ like the phrase
‘ita me di amabunt‚' and is similar in form
to ⁴ medius fidius ' and ‘maceston’ From
the short ¹ me ' some have supposed a deri-
ntion from μά ς but
the Latin words are decidedly of the nomina-
tive termination. ’ Me ' is often an 811011ιί0,
as in i. 2. l 1 ” Miseram Ι 11ιέ verelor‚” and
iu mutity would be most naturally short·

in the ease of a familiar brier expres-

’ Μ81181018· 81111 ’ medius fidius ’ were
the common osths 01· 111811, 88 ’ mecastor'

against this is that

81111 ’ edepol ' os women. But see notes on

'³ j v. 2. 28. and Hecyra i. 2. 8.

2⁴. Ee te ultro accunabit: et dabis Ei

turo supplicium] ‘And she will go on to

ζ muse 7011, 81111 7011 will be punished over
ἐξ and above! The soree of thep word‘ ultro'
’,ἵε-- hus is that she would not defend herself
against Phaedria's reproaches, but would
’ν taho the initiative 81111 8001188 111111, 81111 that

bovonis not only fail in bringing her to

³ 1η· unm, but woyuld over and above that

35

have to submit to punishment at her hands.
See the note on ⁸ ultro ¹ Andria i. 1. 73.

27. Prudens sciens, Vivus vidensque pe-
reo] ⁴ 1 am perishing with all my wits
about me, and with my eyes wide open!
These words are frequently thus joined.
For ’ prudens sciens ' compare Heaut. iv. 1.
19: “Certo scio te inscientem atque im-
prudentem dicere ac facere omnia.''
uses the phrase several times. One passage
from his letters, Ad Fam. vi. 6, is very
like the text: “ Ut in fabulis Amphiaraus,
sic ego prudens et sciens 811 pestem ante
oculos positam sum profectus.” ’ Vivus vi-
dens ue ’ is an imitation of the Greek ζῶν
καὶ λέπων or ζῶν καὶ παρών. Cicero·
quotes the proverb once or twice. We find
it in Lucretius iii. 1046 (Lachmann):

“Mortua 0111 vita est prope jam vivo atque
videnti,” and iu Plautus, Mostellaria 11. 1.
79, we have another form of the proverb:

“Ludos e go hodie vivo praesenti huic seni
Faciam quod credo mortuo nunquam fore.”

34. Nostrisundi calamitas] ’Τ118 blight
01· my estate. for she interrepts what Ι
ought to receive. ' The meaning is so sim-
ple as hardly to require a note. Parmeno
complains that his young master' s liberality
is absorbed 117 Thais. He uses a word
which is generally applied to agriculture,
-- ‘calamitas' See Long' s note on Cicero,
In Verrem Act. ii. 3. 98. ‘Intercipi03
is also sometimes used of the damage
done to crops by weathcr, animals, 810..
asin Ovid, Metam. viii. 290, speaking of
the boare

”Ν11110 matura metit fleturi vota 0010111,
Et Cererem in spicis intercipit ;’'

Cicero
