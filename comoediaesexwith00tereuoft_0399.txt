INTRODUCTION.

'fn Hecyra takes its name from the fact that its plot turns upon the
misunderstanding betw0en a mother and daughter-in·law. Colman has
translated the word ‘step-mother? but ἑκυρό. is etymologically, and in

a daughter-in·law.

have any peace till he consented to take to himself a wife. By a strange
coincidence the wife selected sor him was this very Philumena, whom he
had met at night on his way to his mistress's house; and her mother was

 , only too glad to have her married, hoping that she would be saved from

public disgmce. But things did not turn out as smoothly as she ex·

aprica towards him. Philumena, on the other hand, bore his neglect

Pamphilus abandoned Bacchis altogether, and became devotedly attached
