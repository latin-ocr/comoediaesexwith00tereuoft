xxxiv IN TRODUOTION.

“ Quando'quidem illam a me distrahit necessitaS.'’
(Hec. iii. 5. 42.)

“ Tum equidem istuc os tuum impudens videre nimium vellem.’'
(Eun. iii. 5. 49.)

“ Equidem hercle nescio. Vin scire? At ita me servet J fipiter.'’·
(Phorm. v. 3. 24.)

The following notices may conclude this head:

via. “ Tractare ; sed vi, et via pervulgata patrum.”
(Heaut. i. 1. 49.)

vide. “ Tu, ut tempus est diei, vide sis ne quo hinc abeas longius.’'
(Heaut. i. 2. 38.)

Compare Heaut. iv. 8. 30. Adelph. ii. 2. 31. Hec. iii. 5. 34. The.
same contraction occurs in videre and videt .-

redi. “Nam hercle etiam 1100 restat. Illuc quaeso re'di quo
coepisti, Aeschine.” (Adelph. ii. 1. 36.)

“ Concaluit ι quid vis? Re‘di, redi.”
(Heaut. ii. 3. 108.)

In the latter quotation we have an instance of the change of pronun-
ciation before noticed in the case of maqis. Abi is very frequently
monosyllabic. See Hecyra iv. 1. 42 ².

3. When ‘ u’ is followed or preceded by another vowel.

The common instances of ejus, hujus, cujus, &c., have been already
noticed ; nor need we 11010 instance such cases as ‘ studuerit‚' ‘voluerit,’

‘cubuerit,’ ‘potuerit,' and generally speaking all tenses of verbs in Δ

which the final consonant of the root is followed by ‘ u.’

duint is not contracted in Terence, except once in the compound

erduint :
P “ At 10 Di Deaeque perduint cum isto odio Lache,’'

(Hec. i. 2. 59,)

and in this passage this reading is 1101 quite certain, though there is
the best authority for the text as here given. The following less

common words may be added here :

² In some of my notes I have followed Ritschl and others in speaking of ‘ abi,' ⁴ roga,’
‘ mane,' ‘ jube,' &c.‚ as if they were pronounced ⁹ ⁹. It is more consistent, however, with
the general custom of Terence to treat them, as I have here done, as monosyllables. The
student will easily find very many more examples of the use of each of these words.
