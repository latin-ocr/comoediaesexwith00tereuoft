return from their errand, and report that
the ladies are not far behind with all their
paraphernalia, maid-servants, jewelry, and
garments, enough to fin the house. This
throws Clinia into 110 8111811 alarmz for he
had left Antiphila poor, and now she has
got all this substance. Syrus perceiving
his mistake proceeds to undeceive him3
and tells him how he had found her in
every respect as Clinia would desire, not at
all like one who has been making a good
livelihood in his absence. And when she was
told that Clinia had returned, she showed
by her conduct that her affections were still
his. This naturally relieves Clinia of all
his apprehensions. Clitipho wishes to
know then who it is to whom all these fine
things belong. It turns out that Syrus has
brought home Bacchis, Clitipho' s mistress,
having found her in a good humour. 011-
tipho is very much enraged when he first
hears of this: but Syrus explains to him
that all is arranged. Bacchis is to pass for
Clinia's mistress, and Antiphila is to be
given in charge to Clitipho's mother, for
reasons which Syrus cannot explain at pre-
sent. After some discussion Syrus per-
suades his young master that this is the
best thing that could possibly have hap-

p3ened for he will be able to enjoy the
society of Bacchis without any risk of de-
tection. He reminds him that he runs a
greater risk himself than any of them, and
that therefore heis pretty sure not to go to
sleep in the matter3 and if there is risk
Clitipho m put up with it for the sake of
the pl ‘for nothing worth enjoying
can be thout some danger. Bacchis

is well up in her part 3 and so 811 that he has
to do is to take care that he does not betray
them. He must not indulge in any tokens of
love before his father. He must remember
that for t-he present Bacchis is Clinia’s
mistress, and behave accordingly. Clitipho
and Clinia both fall into the scheme; and
so they begin to play their gamo.
