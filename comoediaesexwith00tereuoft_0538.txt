(10ηο me; but I went further than that, and
actually gave him my money.' The original
idea of ‘ objicere ' would be ‘ to throw food
before animals.’ Compare virgil, Aeneid.
vi. 419—422, speaking of Cerberus:

⁴⁴ Cui vates, horrere videns jam colla colu-
Μεὶ111118 soporatam et medicatis frugibus
0111111111.1 Ille fame rabida tria guttura
pandens
Corripit objectam.''

Livy uses it of a concession to popular cla-
mour. “Aptissimum tempus erat. vindi-
catis seditionibus, delenimentum animis
Bolani agri divisionem objici‚'' iv. 51. Te-
rence generally uses it with such words as
‘.malum,' ‘laetitia,' &c. See Hecyra iii. 1.
6. Heaut. i. 2. 12. With ‘qui vivat’ in
the next line compare Adelphi v. 9. 23:
‘⁸ Huic aliquid paulum prae manu Dederis
unde utatur,'' and see note.

8. Modo ut Ιιοσ consilio possiet discedi]
‘ One can only hope that by this plan things
may be brought to 0 successful issue, that
he may marry her.' ‘ Discedo’ is some-
times used in the sense ‘to come off well,
out of a business! Compare v. 8. 58:

‘⁸ Na. Satin tibi est, Chreme? Ph.
Imo vero pulchre discedo et probe;
Et praeter spem.''

Cicero uses the word several times in this
way. See Forcellini. The verb is a passive
impersonal in this passage.

12. Nuntia hanc· venturam] ‘ Yon,
Geta‚' says Demipho, ‘ go to Phanium, and
give her notice that Nausistrata is coming
to see her! They are now standing by
Chremes’ house, so that Demipho properly
uses ‘ hanc ' for Nausistrata, who isat 1101110
there.

13. Arqentum] Geta now soliloquizes
011 the present state of affairs. ‘ 1 have got
the money for Phaedria; and not a word is
said about the lawsuit; and it is arranged
that Phanium shall not leave this house at
present. Now what will come next? What
will happen ? You are as deep in the mud
as ever; you wiu have to pay your creditors
by borrowing from others. It is true that
the punishment which was imminent 1100
110011 staved off ; but meanwhile, if you do
not look out, your account of lashes is in-
creasing.’ The phrase ‘in eodem luto hae-
sitas ' is quoted by Lactantius viij2, accord-
ing to Lindenbrog. Plautus uses the word
in 0 similar sense. Pseudolus iv. 2. 27 z

“ Perii, nunc homo in medio luto est.''

Persa iv. 3. 74 :

“ Neque mihi haud imperito eveniet tali nt
in luto haeream.’'

The idea is simple enough ; Geta is reckon·
ing up his liabilities to punishment, as if
they were ordinary debts. So we say, ‘Yon
are over head and ears in debt ς’ ‘ you sink
deeper and deeper.' ‘ Versura solvere ’ was
a term used of those who borrowed money
from a new creditor to pay an old 011ος 00
that besides paying the interest on their old
debts, they had to pay interest also on the
sum that they borrowed, and so on, till
