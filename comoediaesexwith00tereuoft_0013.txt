’,εἴ ¹ 1565). It must be considered as the only one with any pretension

to original authority, and as the source from which most of the ex-
isting manuscripts have arisen. Ι ha‘ve often in the following notes
had occasion to mention the readings of the Bembine Manuscript‚

ἡ and it is a strong argument for its superior authority that in many

cases it gives the more difficult reading, which has evidently been

s , misunderstoOd and altered by the transcriber of some other copy.

I have not had the opportunity of consulting the Manuscripts.
Many of their readings are quoted by the various editors of
Terence. The English copies have been collated by Hare and
Bentley, not, however, with any important results. Their text,
as quoted by Bentley, is generally bad where it deviates from the
common text. In deciding between conflicting readings, Ι have
frequently, as will be seen in my Commentary, allowed the read-
ing of the Bembine Manuscript to settle a doubtful point.

DONATUS is the most famous of the ancient commentatore on
Terence. He lived in the fourth century after Christ, and was the
reputed master of J erome. (See note on Hecyra ii. 1. 4.) Many
have, however, entirely denied the genuineness of the commentary
which now passes under his name, but without sufficient reason.
The commentary is valuable both critically and exegetically‚ and Ι
have frequently found reason to prefer it to the opinion of later
editors. It is to the commentators what the Bembine Manuscript
is to the Codices, and may fairly be estimated in the same
manner. Often‚ no doubt, it contains. traces of the genuine text3
as often, perhaps, it is wrong. In using it we must therefore call
in the aid of independent critical judgment. The Manuscripts of «

Donatus are confessedly very defective, and in many places hope-

lessly corrupt. Ι have always quoted from the edition of Zeune,
which presents the text of Donatus in the best shape.
EUGRApmns is supposed to have lived at the end of the sixth
