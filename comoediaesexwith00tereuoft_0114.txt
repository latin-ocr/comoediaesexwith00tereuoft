Ac‘r III. ScsNa I. Mysis returns with
Lesbia to the house of Glycerium, which
must be imagined as standing on one side
of the stage, opposite to the house of Simo.
Simo thus overhears their conversation about
the honourable conduct of Pamphilus in
promising to acknowledge Glycerium's child.
Simo, though at first perplexed, mugi-atu..
lates himself on seeing through the trick,
which he regards as a scheme concocted for
the purpose of preventing the marriage.

The metre is trimeter iambic.

2. Fidelem haud ferme . . . virum] ⁴ You
will scarcely ever find a man faithful to a
woman.r ‘ Ferme' is used with negatives
in limitation of the negative, and is found
in this sense in Livy: “ Nec ferme res an-
tiqua alia est nobilior,’' i. 243 and Cicero,
Rep. i. 45: “ Quod non ferme decernitur,
nisi quum tetra prodigia nuntiata sunt.’'
So too in Plautus, Menaechmei ii. l. 39:
“ Propterea huic urbi nomen Epidamno in-
ditum est Quia nemo ferme huc sine damno
devortitur.”

3. Ab Andria eet ancilla] ‘The maid-
servant of the Andrian.' So Plautus, Pseudol.
ii. 2. 221 “Eme tn, an non es, ab illo
milite Macedonio Servos ejus ?’' Bentley’s
division of the speeches, as in the text,
seems most natural. Simo speaks first
doubtfully, half to Davus3 Davus evades
the question: then Simo speaks confidently
upon recognizing Mysis as she comes nearer.

The commentators suppose that Simo could
not have known Mysis by sight, and that
he therefore asks Davus, who would know
her. But he represents him in Act i. sc.
1. 56, as having watched her household,
and 110 doubt he had made acquaintance
with her maid. This is however refin-
ing too far. We do not require that 811
the characters in 8 play should be formally
introduced before they shall seem to know
each other.

7. Actum est] The phrase is common
enough. ‘ It is all over.' See Eun. i. l. 9.
Heaut. Prol. 12. ‘⁴ Acta haec res est,” ⁴ this
matter is done for,’ Heaut. iii. 3. 3. It is
derived in the first instance from judicial
phraseology, of a suit once ended, that

could not be begun again. Compare note
on Adelphi ii. 2. 24.

5 ξῖὲ Ne in mora illi sie] See note on ii.

ll. Ex pereyrina] For his children
would be illegitimate in the eye of the law.

Herodotus mentions a similar law among ⁶

the Lycians, i. 173: ’Ἢν δὲ ἀνὴρ ἀστὸς γυ-
ναῖκα ξένην ἔχῃ ἄτιμα τὰ τέκνα γίνεται.
In the case of the children of Pericles aspe-
cial law was introduced to legitimize them.

Jam scio] Simo suddenly fancies that
118 has discovered the meaning of all this
conversation, and that it is a mere suble

{lv-hich they have invented to impose upon
im.
