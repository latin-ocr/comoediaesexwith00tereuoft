PROLOGUS.

ὲ Graecis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas.

Idem Menandri Phasma nunc nuper dedit ;

Atque in ssesauro scripsit causam dicere

10

Prius unde petitur aurum quare sit suum
Quam ille qui petit unde is sit thesaurus sibi,
Aut unde in patrium monumentum pervenerit.
Dehinc ne frustretur ipse se, aut sic cogitet,

“ Defimctus jam sum, nihil est quod dicat mihi;''

Is ne erret moneo et desinat lacessere.
Habeo alia multa quae nunc condonabitur3
Quae proferentur post, si perget laedere

Ita ut facere instituit.

ξ bene longae,” Cicero‚ad Attio. xiv. 7: “Bene

may mean, either that by a too faithful
translation he violated the Latin idiom ς οι·
that although he translated well enough. he

following account of the argument of this
play. A young woman is privately brought

'aaa the young woman, whom he takes for
an apparition of the goddess. By degrees

,ht- awe gives place to a more tender feeling,

and a happy marriage is the result.

10. Thesauro] The story of this play· ιι
flua given by Donatus. A young man had
sold a farm in which was his father-'s tomb.

Ἴ Tm years after his father's death he sends

12. Quam ille] We must supply ⁸ dicat,’
otherwise we should naturally have ‘ quam
illum! For a similar change from the in-
finitive to the conjunctive aster a compara-
tive see note on Andria iv. 5. 3.

15. Desunt-lus jamnum] ‘I am now
quit of him ε he has nothing to say to me!
Compare the use of ‘ defungor ' in Phormio
v. 8. 32: ‘⁴ Cupio misera in hac re jam de-
fungier '' and Adelp hiiii. 4. 62: “Utinam
hic agit modo defunctum. ’' Lavinius· ιι sup-
posed to con gratulate himself on having
heard the worst that can be said against
him. Terence replies that he gives him a
respite for the present during good be-
haviour, but that he has plenty left to bring
uplaqgmgztaffnam condonabitur] ‘ Con-
dono' takes a double accusative, as in
Phemio v. 7. 54: “Argentum qnod habes
condonamus te.” Here the verb is used
finpersonally, retaining one os the accusa-
tives of the active. The same occurs with
other verbs that have a similar construction
in the active, as ⁴ doceo,' ‘celo‚' ‘monem'

Lcogo) We may compare Hecyra iv. 4. 23:

“Hoc nos celatos non oport-uit.” The cor-
responding Greek idiom is of common oc-
currence in such phrases as σιἰιὲν ἠδικη-
μένος, φάρμακα δεδιδάχθαι, τοῦτο κρύ·
πτεσθαι, ἀναγκαζόμενος δεινά.

20. Postquam Aediles emerunt] Thepe-
nultima οῖ’ emerunt’ is shortened. This
lieence occurs not only in Plautus and

Terence, but in other authors also. See
Virgil, Aen. ii. 774· “Obstupui. steterunt-
que comae, et vox faucibus haesit.” In

Propertius ii. 8. 10 we have· ‘Et Thebae
steterunt, altaque Troja fuit‚'' where how-
ever Paley reads steterantf preren-ing a
lax use of ythe pluperfect to a change of the
