 

TERENGE AND THE N'EW COMEDY. 495

παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως λαμβάνειν, καὶ ταῦτ’ ἀεὶ
ἔλεγεν διὰ ταύτην ἢν λέγω τὴν δωρεὰν
&murone ἔσχε μ’ ὃ κακοδαίμων δωρεάν.
(Meineke, Frag. Poet. Comic. vol. iv. p. 511.)

HEAUTONTIMOBUMEN OS.

In the Prologue to this play Terence says:

“ Ex integra Gmoa integram comoediam>
Hodie sum acturus Heautontimorumenon3

Duplex quae ex argumento facta est simplici.”
(vv. 4-6.)

It has been maintained in the note on that passage that these words of
Terence most probably mean that ‘ now there are two plays on the same
subject, a Greek aud a Latin one‚’ and in accordance with this view we

find no other play but the Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος of Menander noticed by
any authority as the original of the ‘ Heautontimorumenos.’ The
extant verses of Menander to which we can find a parallel in the Latin

⁰ play are very few. The following passages may be compared.

Heaut. i. 1. 9, 10:

‘⁴ Nam proh Deum atque hominum fldem, qnid vis tibi?
Quid quaeris? annos sexaginta natus es.”

The Scholiast on ‘Plato (Bekk. p. 380) hae preserved these nme of

M⁰¹¹⁸⁰d⁰‘' Πρὸς τῆς Ἀθηνεῆ somme, mov-‘oe zm
τοσαῦθ’ ; officii γάρ ἐστιν ἐξήκοντά σοι.
(Frag. 'Emm i.)
Menedemus, describing his feelings when he returned to the comforts
of his home after the loss of his son, says:

“ Ubi video haec, coepi cogitare: ‘ Hem! tot mea
solius solliciti sint causa, ut me unum expleant Ρ
Ancillae tot me 'vestiant P sumtus domi

Tantos ego solus faciam θ’ ” · (Heaut. i. 1. ⁷6—79.)
In the following fragment of Menander,
Λοιηρὸν θεραπηίης ἀργυρώματα, (Fragrn.‘1·20w. ii.)

we probably have a portion οἱ· a similar speech where the old man is
describing, with more detail than he does in Terence, the various pre-
