45. Vos me indotatis] ‘Perhaps you
think that Ι act the patron only for por-
tionless girls. I am in the habit of doing
so for heiresses too.' Phormio purposely
expresses himself ambiguously. He means,
⁴ 1 will show you that I can assert the right
of women with sortunes, such as your wife
Nausistrata, as well as of poor young women
like Phanium! His words will also bear
the meaning, ‘Do you think that 1 will
waive my right of being the patron of Pha-
nium now that she is no longer poor?’
But the meaning is left uncertain; and
Demipho, seeing no particular application
of the words to their own business, treats
them with contempt. Phormio then goes
on to show them that he is acquainted with
their'secret, and can use it so as to place
Nausistrata on his side against them.

50. Sepultus aum] ‘ Ι am a dead man!
Plautus uses the word rather more literally
of a swoon in Amphitruo v. 1. 21—24 :

‘⁴ Sed qnid hoe? quis hic est senex?
Qui ante aedes nostras sic jacet?
Numnam hunc perc-ussit Jupiter?
Sepultus est quasi sit mortuus.''

Here it is evidently a translation of the
common Greek word τέθηπα occurring fre-

quently in Homer. Pindar also 11118 τάφε,
Pyth. iv. 168. Compare Herodotus ii. 156 ε
τέθηπα δὲ ἀκούων, εἰ νῆσος ἀληθέως ἐστὶ
πλωτή.

52. Ut ludos facit] ‘ How he makes
game of the thing Γ See note on Andria 111.

53. Missum te sacimue] ⁴ We let you
go.’ See note on Andria iv. l. 56.

54. Arqentum . . . condonamus te] ‘ We
make you a present of the money that you
have! ‘ Condono ’ is used by Plautus with
a double accusative3 see Bacchides v. 2. 26:
‘¹ Si quam habes te condono. '' Lindemann
also quotes a passage from Afranius: “Id
aurum me 0001101181.υ In most passages
of Plautus one of the accusatives is omitted,
generally the accusatixe of the thing ς and
in Eunuchus, Prol. 17, we have the passive

impersonal 118011 with the accusative of the ’

thing, as is common with verbs that take a
double accusative in the active. See note.

60. Nisi] ‘I only know for certain that
Ι have never told any one.' This elliptioel
use of¹ nisi’ is common in Terence. See
note on Heaut. v. 2. 4.

61. Injeci scrupulum] See note on
Adelphi 11. 2. 20.
