eho an non alemus,

Compare notes on ‘amab0‚’ i. 2. 50, and
iii. 3. 31. All the commentators observe a
peculiar propriety in the use of the words
'in these two lines; ⁴‘ Quia,'' as Donatus re-
marks, “ pax, datio, deditio, conventio, col-
loquium, militiae verba sunt.’' One cer-
tainly would not have suspected any such
hidden meaning in such common forms of
expression.

18. Em Aethiopia est usque haec] ‘This
girl comes all the way from Aethiopia!
‘Usque’ is very commonly used in this
manner. We may compare Adelphi iv. 5.
21 ι “ Miletum usque, obsecro ?'’ ‘ tell me
does he mean to take her all the way to
Miletus ?' Virgil, Aen. vii. 288, 289 :

‘⁴ Et laetum Aeneam classemque ex aethere
Dziiqdlagriiam Siculo prospexit ab usque
Pachyno.”

From this use it passes into a more general
sense of strengthening the expression to
which it is attached, as in Andria i. 2. 28 z
‘⁴ Verberibus caesum te, Dave, in pistrinum
dedam usque ad necem ;’' and when used
alone signifies ‘ utterly,' ‘exceedingly‚’ asin
Adelphi ii. 2. 5: “ Ego vapulando, ille ver-
berando usque ambo defessi sumus.’'

23. Fae periclum in literis, Fae in pa-
laestra, in musicis] ⁴ Try him in letters,
in gymnastics, in music; I will warrant him
accomplished in every thing which a young
gentleman ought to know.’ These were the
usual elements of 8 good education among
the Greeks. We may take Aristotle's ac-
count of them as quite sufficient for our
present purpose. See Polit. viii. 2: Αι μεν
οὖν καταβεβλημέναι νῦν μαθήσεις, καθά-
περ ἑλέ θη πρότερον, ἐπαμφοτερίζουσιν.
Ἐστι ἐξ τέτταρα σχεδὸνᾶ παιδευειν

Fac periclum in literis,

εἰώθασι, γράμματα καὶ γυμναστικὴν καὶ
μουσικὴν καὶ τέταρτον ἔνιοι γραφικήν.

Of these he says that γράμματα and γρα-

φικη were learnt for utility; yppvaaruev'y as a
manly habit, while μουσική is more closely
connected with moral education. See the
interesting discussion of this question 111 the
remaining chapters of this book. Aristotle
represents more truly the current feeling of
Greeks on the subject of education than
Plato. Μουσικὴ is often used more generally
in the sense of ‘ a liberal education,’ in-
cluding γράμματα. See note on Heaut. Prol.
23. It was not unusual for domestic slaves
to be very well educated, that they might
act as secretaries, or might be able to enter-
tain their owners by other accomplishments.
So Horace, describing an owner puffin'g off
his slave for sale, says,

‘⁴ Verna ministeriis ad nutus aptus heriles,
Litterulis Graecis imbutus, idoneus arti
Cuilibet,” Epist. ii. 2. 6—8,

where see Macleane's note. Parmeno lays
particular stress on the word ⁸ liberum! He
warrants Dorus to be as well educated as
any young ‘ gentleman.’ Colman quotes
the following passage from Shakespeare,
which looks almost like an imitation of
Terence:

‘⁴ Concede me what I am ; and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall be-
Τὴοὲῗέῖω of my intent. I'll serve this
Thzssksshalt present me as an eunuch to
ahili} be worth thy paim for 1 ean
Axfcinsgpeak to him in many sorts of mu-
Tliaigkwill allow me very worth his ser-

woe' Twelfth Night, *Aet i. soene 2.
