54. Utrum taceamne an praedicem ?]
‘ Which shall I do, shall I keep it quiet, or
tell it ?' Donatus, and after him most com-
mentators pronounce that either ⁴ utrum'
or ‘ ne ' is superfluous ; or that the form
⁴ utrumne ’ is here separated by tmesis.
Neither explanation is right in this passage.
⁴ Utrum ' is here used as a pronoun followed
by a disjunctive question. Compare Plautus,
Captivi ii. 2. 18:

‘⁴ Sed utrum strictimne attonsumm dicam
esse an per pectinem
Nescio ;''

Pseudolus ii. 4. 19: ‘⁴ Dic, utrum Spemne
an Salutem te salutem Pseudole ?'' and
Terence, Adelphi iii. 3. 28:

Di vostram fidem,
Uia-um studione id sibi habet, an laudi
Foliiizl,t 851 perdiderit gnatum ?''

 

The ordinary explanation has arisen from
the fact that we sometimes find ‘ nam' or
‘ ne’ added to ‘utrum ’ in emphatic ques-
tions, 55 they are to other interrogative
words. Compare ‘numquidnam' in An-
dria i. 4. 8. The advice which Dorias gives
is well drawn out by Plautus, Miles Glorio-
sus ii. 6. 90:

‘⁴ Nae tu hercle, si te di amant, linguam
comprimes
Posthac, etiam illud quod scies, nesciveris,
Neu videris quod videris ;'’

for, as he says,

 

Hominem servum 51105
Domitos habere oportet oculos et manus
Orationemque.’'

56. Hac re . . .secerie] ⁴ In this way
you will clear yourself of all trouble, and do
her a favour! For *evolvas ’ compare
Phormio v. 4. 5: “Ego nullo possum re-
medio me evolvere ex his turbisss’ Com·
mentators have differed much as to ‘ illi!
Some refer it to Pamphila, some to Thais.
Madame Dacier thinks that it would have
been no kiudness to Pamphilatoconceal what
had happened; she was too well bred to
wish to hide it ε 5 thoroughly Pax-isian idea.

Thais on the other hand is interested in ·

Pamphila’s recognition as a citizen, and
therefore would be anxious to have this
blot on her fame concealed. I think that
Donatus is certainly right in referring it to
Pamphila, who has just been mentioned.
Thais would not be introduced abruptly as
⁴ illi! We should have had ‘ herae!

Ac'r IV. Senam V. Chremes staggers
upon the stage sorely puzzled at the effect
of his first debauch. He cannot understand
how it is that the wine has had such m
effect on him, for while he was at table he
felt quite sober. He tells them that Thais
is coming after him, indeed he does not
understand how it is that he has passed her
in the street.

The Metre is iambic tetrameter.
