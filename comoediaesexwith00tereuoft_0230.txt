δάλῳ. (Dial. de Historia scribenda.) The
original of this line seems to have been
a line of Turpilius:

‘⁴ Misero mihi mitigat sandalio caput,''

quoted by Foreellini from Nonius.

Acr V. Sana· VIII. Chaerea comes
out of Thais' house· 111 8 state of unbounded
joy. To Parmeno’ s great surprise he
thanks him as the cause of 8111118 happiness,

“ and tells him that Pamphila has been

found to be 811 Athenian citizen3 that Thais
has been taken under his father’s protec-
tion ; and that both himself and his brother
are now supremely happy. Phaedria joins
him ς and while they are congratulating each
other on their good fortune, Thraso is in
tha greatest despair at what he hears, and
begs Gnatho to arrange with Phaedria that
he may have some opportunity of seeing
Thais even now. Gnatho undertakes the
office on a promise of perpetual dinners at
Thraso's house; and manages to persuade
the young men to keep up a show of
friendship to Thraso, reminding them of
his good dinners and wine, and his utter

harmlessness as regards Thais; Thraso 88
usual attributing his success to his own un·-
rivalled powers of attraction.

The Metre is as follows3 v. l. 20—64,
trochaic tetrameter catalectic; 2-19, iam-
bic tetrameter.

1. O populares, ecquis me hodie vivit
fortunatior ?] This is Bentley's arrange·
ment of the line, on the authority of the
English manuscripts; and as it is necessary
to the metre I have followed Perlet and
others in adopting it in preference to the
ordinary readings, ‘ ecquis me vivit hodie)
For according to this latter text ⁴ me vivit'
stands for 8 trochee, ‘vivit' being pro-
nounced as a monosyllable, which is very
harsh; such conti-actions ocean-ing 88 a
rule where one of the consonants is a liquid,
as, to take an extreme case, ‘vivendi’ in
Andriai. 1. 25, whereseenote.

8. In tranquillo] ⁴1 am glad that my
brother’ s love' 18 now quite in smooth water!
A common metaphor 111 various forms. See
Phormio' iv. 4. 7, 8.
