HEOYRA.

Dic mihi, Philotis, ubi te oblectasti tam diu P

Ph. Minime equidem me oblectavi‚ quae cum milite

lo

Corinthum hinc sum profecta inhumanissimo :
Biennium ibi perpetuum misera illum tuli.

Pa. Aedepol te desiderium Athenarum arbitror,
Philotium, cepisse saepe, et te tuum

Consilium contemsisse. Pla.

Non dici potest 15

Quam cupida eram huc redeundi, abeundi a milite,
Vosque hic videndi, antiqua ut consuetudine
Agitarem libere inter vos convivium3

Nam illi haud licebat nisi praefinito loqui

Quae illi placerent.

Pa. Haud opinor commode

Finem statuisse orationi militem.
Ph. Sed quid hoc negoti est modo quae narravit mihi

men3 but we find both used frequently by
men. For ‘ aedepol ’ see note on Eunuchus
v. 2. 28. We find ⁴ ecastor ' used by a man
in Plautus, Asinaria v. 2. 49. 86. Terence
uses the word correctly. For the derivation
of the word see note on ‘ mehercles,' Eunu-
chus i. l. 22.

9. Te oblectasti] See note on Eun. i. 2.

14. Et te tuum consilium contemsisse]
‘ Surely, my dear Philotis, 1 think that you
must often have longed for Athens, and
have repented of your decision.' Donatus
remarks that the phrase ‘ desiderium Athe-
narum ’ is an ἀμφιβολία. He means, that
it may either mean ¹ you longed for Athens‚’
or, ⁴ you were much missed at Athens!
For the latter meaning we may compare
Cicero's expression: ‘⁴ Brutus erat in desi-
derio civitatis‚'’ ‘ Brutus was much missed
in the city,' Phil. x. 7. But the former is
most natural here3 and the repetition of
‘te' is at most a natural emphasis. We
may compare Horace, Epist. i. 14. 21, 22:

 

Fornix tibi et uncta popina
Incutiunt urbis desiderium, video.’'

I do not find another instance of the phrase
‘contemnere consilium? but the meaning
is plain.

18. Aqitarem . . . convivium] Compare
Heaut. iv. 4. 11 = ‘¹ Apud eum miles Dio-
nysia agitat,’' and note. For this parti-
cular phrase see Plautus, Asinaria v. 1.

‘¹ Age ergo agitemus ·hoc convivium
Vino et sermone suavi.”

19. Nam ῑιιι· naua ziz-ebat nim· praefinito

loqui] ‘ For there 1 was not allowed to
speak except in a set fashion.¹ Donatus
notices the reading ‘illi.⁷ The ordinary
copies have ¹ illic,' which would suit the.
line equally well; but we may fairly can-
clude that the less common word is to be
preferred. ‘ Illi ’ is simply the old locative,
like ⁴ ibi,¹ ⁶ ubi,’ and all such forms. See
notes on Adelphi i. 2. 36; v. 3. 57.
‘ Praefinito ' is the adverbial form answer-
ing to the Greek -ως, as ‘ consulto,' ‘ op-
tato,' διο. There is no need therefore to
supply ‘tempore’ with Donatus. ‘More’
would be the more natural word. ‘ Ι could
talk only in set phrase, and as he liked.’
The sort of regimen which Philotis was
under may be understood by comparing
Plautus, Asinaria, Act IV. Scene 2, where
the parasite is laying down rules for the
conduct of the mistress of the Braggadocio
Diabolus. Among other things, he says,
she is to be exceedingly chary of speaking
to any man, even to any male god. le “

. following lines are to the point:

“Tales ne cuiquam homini admoveat, nisi
t1 i3

Quum jaciet, ‘ Te' ne dicat: nomen nomi-
D‘ssltl. invocet sibi quam lubebit propi·
Dgiiig‘ 3nullum. Si magis religiosa fu-
Tigiliisszan tu pro illa ores, ut sit pro-

pitius.'' (vv. 34—38.)

22. Sed quidhoc neqoti est] Compare
Andria v. 2. 8: “ Quid istic tibi negoti
est ?'' Adelphi iv. 5. 733 and note on
Eunuchus iii. 4. 8.
