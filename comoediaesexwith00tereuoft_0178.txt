Unde is Ρ ΟΙι. Egone Ρ nescio hercle, neque unde eam, neque

quorsum eam:

6- 9. Ecce autem alteruml] ‘Here you
have the other brother too, talking all sorts
of nonsense about love. If this one once
begins, you will say that the other was
mere child's play to him! In arranging
these lines Ι have followed in the main
Zeune rather than Bentley, who has divided
them thus:

‘⁴ Hic vero est, qui si occeperit,
Ludum jocumque dices fuisse illum al-
Priaaeaerdtuh’ujus rabies quae dabit.”

The objections to this arrangement are
two: (Ι) It is not likely that Terence
would introduce the clausula in this man-
ner. On this point see the Introduction.
(2) The introduction of the iambic trimeter
is harsh. ΤΙιε only change that I have
made is in the arrangement of the words.
For ‘ fuisse illum alterum‚’ I have read
¹ illum alterum fuisse,' and for ‘praeut hu-
jus rabies quae dabit,' ‘praeut quae dabit
hujus rabies! This order is necessary for
the metre, which is now iambic tetrameter
catalect-ic in both lines, and is in accord-
anoe with the usual construction of ¹ praeut’
and ‘praequam,' which are placed in im-
mediate connection with the word denoting
that with which the comparison is made.
Compare Plautus, Menaech. ii. 3. 29, 30:

“ Folia nunc cadunt
Praeut (si triduum hoc hic erimus) tum ar..
bores in te cadent.”
Mercator iv. 2. 1 ι
“Pentheum diripuisse aiunt Bacchas3 nu-

 

gas maximas
Fuisse credo, praeut quo pacto ego diver-
sus distrahor.”

In v. 7, the words “0- infortunatum senem γ’

are in all copies that I have seen given to
Parmeno. So Donatus took them, and ex-
plains that they are intended as a delicate
hint of the denouement of the play, when
Laches is brought to Thais’ house to see

after his son Chaerea; and accordingly ·

Zeune and others read ‘ dicet' in v. 8, re·
feri-ing it to ⁴ senex! It is strange that no
one has remarked the very obvious neces-
sity for assigning the words in question to
Chaerea. After raving about his love, he
naturally execrates this old friend who had
stopped him; and then after Parmeno has
finished his remark, he goes on to dilate a
little more upon his grievance. Parmeno
and he must be supposed to be talking at
once, for he does not perceive the slave at
first. ,

10. Ut illum Di Deaequeseniumperdant]
‘Ut' is said to be put for ‘utinam’ here
and in Heaut. iv. 6. 6. Forcellini does not
quote any instance but the present passage.
We more often meet with ‘ at’ in such forms
of imprecation. (Note on Andria iv. l. ⁴2.)
For the phrase ‘ illum senium qui,’ see note
on Andria iii. 5. 1. The word ‘ senium’ is
used in a passage of Silius Italicus, where it
is uncertain whether it is for ⁴ senem,’ or is
to be taken literally:

‘⁴ Ductor Piso viros spernaces mortis age·
Orldaguer, pulcherque habitum, sed corde
Aesgffgfissf, senium, atque astu superaverat

annos.

Punica viii. 463-465.

Donatus considers ⁶ senium ’ to be used as
an insulting term. On the difference be-
tween the moods ⁴ remoratus est ’ and ⁴ re-
stiterim,’ see note on Andria i. 5. 36.
