mentators observe that this is a meta-
hor from nautical phraseology—that you
your mind to 8 thing 88 you bring a
ship to land. Cicero combines the nautical
and metap horical 1188· “Valde hercule . . .

lum, sic tuam mentem ad philosophiam ap-

nature of the two plays which he had

them. The prolog-nes of Terence differ very
widely from those of Plautus. Plautus, in
imitation οἰ 1118 later Greek practice, intro-
duces allegorical personages (see the Pro-
logues 10 1118 Rudens, Aulularia, and Tri·
nummus), and generally 1188 a 881 010103118,
giving an account of the plot. The nearest
approach to this in Terence is in Act i.
scene l, of this play, which is entirely
narrative, and explanatory of the future
course of the plot. The prologues were
generally spoken in an appropriate dress
(Prol. to Hecyr. 1. l) by one of the
younger actors (see Prol. 10 Heaut. v. 13

perhaps to give young actors an opportunity
of showing their address. Sometimes, on a
special occasion, a veteran actor took this
part (locc. citt. ), when it was necessary to
make special interest with the audience.

of Terence, as he made use of them to

and on his own position, is to be found in
801118 of the παραβάσεις of the Greek co-
medy, though certainly those of Aristo--

phanes are without any Roman parallel in
wit and freedom and enei-gy of style. The
literar-y position of Terence has been din-
cussed in the Introduction.
