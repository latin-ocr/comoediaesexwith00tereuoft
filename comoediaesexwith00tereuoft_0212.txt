31. Attolle pallium] ‘⁴ Vel quia simplex
est, vel quia ebrius, pallium trahit Chremes‚”
Donatus. Zeune explains it ⁴ Tuck up your
cloak,' for the sake of activity. Either sense
will suit the context well enough.

Acr IV. Scarus VII. Thraso appears
with his household troops, and leads them
to the attack of the house, drawing them
out in battle army—right wing and left
wing-keeping himself in reservo, according
to the best precedents. When Thais appears
he determines on a parley, and demands
' Pamphila. Chremes in reply stands up
more maufully than could have been ex-
pected, and claims her as his own sister, and
an Athenian citizen. Upon this Thraso
holds a couucil of war, and they determine
to retire, merely that they may have the
satisfaction of seeing Thais come presently
and make her submission. We must sup-
pose Thraso to come swaggering in, with
a great demonstration of courage, and mak-
ing the most of himself generally, as the
soldier in Plautus, Epidicus. See iii. 3.

or impossibility. So in Andria i. 5. 38:

‘⁴ Egone illam cum illo ut patiar nuptam

In Horace, Sat. ii. 5. 18: ‘⁴ Utne tegam

legpe'glgipge. In Phormio iv. 3. 64 we have

‘⁴ Νἱέἓίθὲἰῖξηίωριιηωε me ille nt etiam ir·

All these forms are condensed expressions.
We may supply the ellipse in the text by
⁴ suadesne ut ego accipiam ?’ Perhaps we-
are to suppose that Gnatho has been ιιι-εἰπε
Thraso to a moderate course, as he does at
the end of the scene, and that Thraso comes ’

⁴ Ne—ut ’ or

on scorning compromise, and walking and
talking like a fire-eater.

2. Sequimini] Donatus observes that on
occasion of a sudden levy the general used
to address the citizens ‘⁴ Qui rem publicam
salvam vultis Me sequimini.” There is no
doubt that Terence intended to thnow in a
