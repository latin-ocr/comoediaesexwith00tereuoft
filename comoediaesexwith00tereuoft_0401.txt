INTRODUOE'ION ‘ro nEcvRA. 327

Bacchis is accordingly sent for, and she completely clears herself and
Pamphilus from the suspicion, and further undertakes to explain the

Ἴ ’ real state of affairs to Myrrhina and Philumena. This brings out the

true history of Philumeua3 and Bacchis is able to inform Pamphilus
that his wife was the owner of the ring which she had received from
him. This entirely changes Pamphilus’ view of the case, and he is

⁶ beside himself with delight.

 

This play is not remarkable for any of the spirit which generally
appears in Terence's plays. The event on which the plot of the play
depende, and the circumstances of Philumena’s illness, having necessarily
to be kept in the background‚ gives an air of restraint to the whole
piece. Indeed, within the whole action, properly so called, there is no
incident except the discovery of the ring. The plot is much more
simple, and the characters less interesting than those of any other
plan and in the treatment of the character of the slave we notice
a marked departure from the ordinary idea of that part. The Parmeno
of the Hecyra is a very different personage from his namesake of the
Eunuchus. He is merely sententious and inquisitive; and the only
amusement which we get out of him is that he is very anxious to
discover hi· master’s secret, and that his curiosity is not gratffied.
