his father’s conduct in pretending this match
with Philumena. which he has discovered
to be a total fiction. Davus explains that
his father's real object is to ascertain the
intentions of Pamphilus, while he fancies
that he kuows him to be devoted to Gly-
cerium, that he may have some one to
blame for the loss of Chremes’ daughter.
By the advice of Davus, Pamphilus agrees
to profess to his father his readiness to
marry Philumena, as the best device sor an
indefinite postponemeut of the affair. The
only danger is that the birth of the child
may be found out.
