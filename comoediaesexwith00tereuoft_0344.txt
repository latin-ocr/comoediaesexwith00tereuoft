11. Nihil pote supra] ‘ Pote’ is another
form of ‘ potis,' as ‘ mage ’ of ‘ magis! It
is commonly used in a neuter sense for
‘ potest.² See note on ‘potis‚’ Eunuchus
ii. 2. 32. Compare Propertius iv. (iii.) 6. 9:

“Et mater non justa piae dare debita
Νέἓζὲῗέ cognatos inter humare rogos.”

Many other instances are given in Forcellini.
Cicero sometimes uses the word in a collo-
quial manner. ‘ Foris crepuit,' see note on
Andria iv. 1. 57.

Acr ΙΙ. Souna IV. Aeschinus comes
to see what Sannio is going to do. He
finds him subdued by his conversation with
Syrus, and quite ready to be paid and have
done with the matter. Ctesipho too is
-anxious that he should be paid, that the
matter may be kept quiet and so escape his
father. Like all young men who are new
to such things, he carries his gratitude to
his brother a little too far. Aeschinus stops
his thanks, and congratulates him on having
found out at last that his brother is worth
something. ‘This was better: he says,
‘wasn't it, than running the country for
such a trifle as this?' All is right n0w3

and he cannot do better than enjoy him-
self.

The Metre is iambic tetrameter.

1. Numquidnam effert ?] ‘ Is he bring-
ing any money with him ?' For ‘ num-
quidnam ’ see note on Andria i. 4. 8.

6. Ne id assentandi mayie . . „facere
existimes] ⁴ That you may not think 1 do
it to flatter you rather than because I am
grateful to you! The full expression would
be ⁴ assentandi causa! This ellipse is con-
fined to the case of ⁴ causa ’ with the geni-
tive of the gerund. In Tacitus, Annal- ii.
59, we have a similar instance, ‘⁴ Germanicus
in Aegyptum proficiscitur cognoscendae an-
tiquitatis ;” and Livy ix. 45 : ⁴⁸ Marsi mise-
runt Romam oratores pacis petendu?
These examples are taken from Madvig,
who accounts for the construction as a geni-
tive of definition (Latin Grammar 417,

Obs. 5). For ‘gratum habeam ’ see note on
Andria iv. 4. 31.

8. Noa paene aero scisse] ‘ I am only
annoyed to think that we were very nearly “
too late in finding it out (that the girl was
to be taken to Cyprus) and that matters had
nearly come to that pass that if every one had
wished it ever so much, they could not have
helped you in the least.’ We must beware
