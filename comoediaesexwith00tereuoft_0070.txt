lxiv IN TRODUOTION.

Terence has the caesura after the syllable following the second mea-
sure. The following lines are a fair example of his metre:
“ Haud similis virglo est virginum Ι no {strarum‚ quas Ι matres
student
Demissis humerlis esse vinctlo ξ pectore ut Ι gracilae sient.
Si qua est habiti} or paulo pugi] {em esse} aiunt, delducsmt cibum z
Tametsi bona est Ι natura, redldunt ξ curatur-{a jfinceas.” ,
(Eun. ii. 3. 21—24.)

“ Quam iniqui sunt Ι patres in omnles ξ adolescentles judices,
Qui aequum esse cens Ι ent n6s a puerlis ξ ilico Ι nasci senes,
Neque illarum affin Ι es esse rerlum ξ quas fert adollescentia.

Ex sua libidfline moderant1ur ξ nunc quae est non Ι quae olim
fuit.” (Heaut. ii. 1. 1—4.)

We meet with a few verses in Terence in which there is a slight
departure from the regular form, arising from a neglect of the caesura.
In these cases the iambus of the fourth foot is replaced by a spondee or
some equivalent foot.

III. IAMmo TRIMETER (υ L υ - Ι υ -ι υ - Ι u L υ -). ⁸

This metre is the staple of Terence's plays. They all commende with
it; and it is generally used in all descriptive passages, with one or two
remarkable exceptions, as in Eunuchus iii. 5, and Hecyra iii. 3. This
kind of verse is too familiar to require any criticism here. Terence, as
all Roman poets, allows himself more licence than the Greek tragedians,
but not more 'than the poets of the New Comedy. If the student will
bear in mind what has been said on the pronunciation of the Latin

language, he will have no difficulty in any of Terence’s iambic trimeters.

We now pass to the shorter forms of iambic verse used by Terence.
Taking the iambic tetrameter catalectic as the integral lineswe find

that it is divisible into two segments, an iambic dimeter, and an iambic

dimeter catalectic. 1
- 2

υ-Λυ-Ιυ-ὐ-ΙΙυ-ὐ-Ιυ-ὐ
Iambic dimeter. Iambic dimeter catalectic.

These are used by Terence as clausulae. Of these we have, first:
IV. humo Dmn'rnn (u -ν υ - Ι u „4 u ..).

Of this we have examples in the following lines, taken from the
‘ Andria’ and ‘ Eunuchus ι’

“ Verebar quorslum evaderetss’ (And. i. 2. 5.)
