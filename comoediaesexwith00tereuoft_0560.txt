was the first to add ‘ Chreme,’ without any
authority„ At the same time he gave the
following words (which have no sense as
coming from Phormio, as they do in all the
old editions) to Chremes. Supposing, as
1 think we must do, that this was so inthe
earliest manuscripts, it is very easy to see
how ‘Chreme' might have been omitted
carelessly before ‘ Chrem‚’ which would
stand as the mark of the speaker. I have
therefore restored the word to the text,
though I have marked it to show that it
has no manuscript authority. ‘Are you
satisfied, Chremes. ²' Nausistrata say s. ‘Not
only satisfied, but I get off splendidly and
well, and beyond my expectatiom‘ For

a similar phrase in v. 18, where the Per-

commented on. Blakesley considers the
term to have been complimentary, but
wrongly, I think. They were an ἀλγηδὼν
ὀφθαλμῶν simply because they were out of
reach, forbidden fruit. ‘Quod’ hem has
the sense of‘ propter quod! See note on
