496 TERENOE AND THE NEW OOMEDY.

parations made by his servants for his comfort. The parallel is not

improbable, though not very important.

Heaut. ii. 3. 51—54:
Anus

Subtemen nebat: praeterea una ancillula
Erat3 ea texebat una, pannis obsita,
Neglecta, immunda illuvie.”

 

The Bembine copy has preserved in its Scholiast the following lines of

. Menander:
Ἐξ ἶσταρίου δ’ ἐκρέματο φιλοπόνος πάνυ.
...... καὶ θεραπαινὶς ἦν μία·
αὕτη συνύφαινε ῥυπαρῶς διακειμένη.
(Fragm. Ἑαυτ. 111.)
Heaut. ii. 4. 4:

“ Nam mihi quale ingenium haberes fuit indicio oratio.”

Compare
Ἀνδρὸς χαρακτὴρ ἐκ λόγου γνωρίζεται,
(Fragm. Ἑαυτ. iv.)
which has been preserved by the same Scholiast.
Heaut. iii. 1. 31:

“ Vehemens in utramque partem, Menedeme, es nimis,''

where the Bembine Scholiast observes, “ Graece πᾶς πατὴρ μωρός;”ι
which may very probably be a fragment of the corresponding passage of
Menander.

Meineke gives another fragment (vii.) z

Μετ’ ἄριστον γὰρ ὡς ἀμυγδάλας ε’γὼ ’
παρέθηκα, καὶ τῶν ῥοιδίων ἐτρώγομεν,

which we may well refer to the description given by Chremes of the
excessive luxury and dissipation of Bacchis and the young men at his
house. Compare Terence, Heaut. iii. 1. 45—53, though in Terence’s
description there is no passage that answers to these lines of Menander.

From the Πλόκιον of Menander is quoted a fragment commencing
with the following lines:

Ἐπ’ ἀμφότερα νῦν ἅτ’ ἐπίκληρος οὖσα δὴ
μέλλει καθευδήσειν. >
(Meineke, Poet. Comic. vol. iv. p. 189.)

Zeune restores the line very differently. See note on Heaut. ii. 3. 101.
If Meineke's conjecture is right, Menander meant ‘ My wife may now,
in virtue of her being an heiress‚ sleep secui-ely. She has made me
