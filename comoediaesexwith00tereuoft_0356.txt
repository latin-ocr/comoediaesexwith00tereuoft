the stage in conversation with Geta. He
can hardly -believe what he hears of Aeschi-
nus3 or that any one of his family cau have
acted so shabbily. Demea overhears him,
— and supposes that he is speaking of this
affair of the music girh but after a short
conversation with Hegio he is· undeceived,
and finds that it is a more serious matter.
He learns for the first time the whole story
of Aeschinus' connexion with Pamphila,
who is now 011 the point of her confine-
ment; and Hegio expresses his determina-
tion to stand by his fflends to the last, and
to 500 that they have justice done them,
out of respect to the memory of his deceased
friend and companion Simulus. Demea is
taken entirely by surprise at this announce-
ment, and determines to see his brother on
the subject. He oomforts himself at the
same time with therefleetion that he had

wat-ned him that this would happen, and
that all this comes of his extreme ind

to Aeschinus. In this state of mind he pro-
ceeds to seek Micio, intending to vent his
indignation upon him; and Hegio warns
him that Micio and he had better see to it

that justice is done, or their characters will ·

suffer for it.

4. Pol haud paternum istuc dedisti]
‘ Truly you have not acted in this like your
father.' This is one of many instances where
⁴ pol ' and ⁴ edepol‚' though properly oaths
of women, are used by men. ¹ Dare’ is in
the sense of ‘ facere! ‘ Paternum dare ' is
‘to give a specimen of one's father! Com-
mentators connect the phrase with ⁴ ruinam
dare,' ‘pugnam dare,' Eun. v. 2. 60. It is
more analogous to the phrase in Heaut. v.
l. 77 : “Adeo exornatum (illum) dabo‚adeo
depexum‚’' where see note. For ‘ dolet ’ in
the following line see note on Eun. i. 2. 12.

what they ought to do, they will not get off
