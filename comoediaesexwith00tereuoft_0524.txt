PHORMIO.

Vereorque ne uxor aliqua hoe resciscat mea3

Quod si fit„ ut me excutiam atque egrediar domo

20

Id restat ; nam ego meorum solus sum meus.

De, Seio ita esse ; et istaec mihi res sollicitudini est-z
Neque defetiscar usque adeo experirien

DOnee tibi id quod pollicitus sumeffecero.

AOTUS QUARTI 'SOENA SECUNDA.

GETA.

Ego hominem callidiorem vidi neminem v
Quam Phormionem: venio ad hominem ut dicerem

‘And Ι am
afraid that somehow or other my wife will
discover this business.

20. Ut me excutiam] , ‘And if my wife
hears of it, all that remains is for' me to
clear myself out, and get out of my house;
for 1 ‘have nothing but myself that I'can call
my own.' ‘Excutiam' may mean either
⁴ drive myself out,' which is Ruhnken’s in*-
terpretation5 or ‘strip myself of all that 1

19. Aliqua] sc. ‘ratione-¹

have,’ according to Zeune. Ι have trans- ’

lated the word by an ambiguous expression3
but 1 incline to Zeune’s view, as most con-
sistent with what follows. So ‘iu Horace
we have ‘excussus' in the ‘similar sense of
‘ privatus τ’

 

Postquam omnis res mea Janum
Ad medium fracta est, aliena negotia curo,
Excussus propriis,'' (Sat. ii. 3. 18—20,)

Carm. iii. 9. 19:
‘⁶ Si flava excutitur Chloe”
(see Macleane’s note); and Virgil:

¹‘ Tua ne, spoliata armis, excussa
magistro,
Deficeret navis tantis surgentibus undis.’'
(Aen. vi. 353, 354.)

Donatus quotes, on the next line, from
Apollodorus:

ἐγὼ γάρ εἶμι τῶν ἐμῶν ἐμὸς μόνος.
Chremes evidently means„ ⁴ 1 am unfortu-
nate enough to have married a fortune, and
I am therefore at my wife’s mercy.' It is
curicus that commentators should make so
much difficulty as they have done of a
simple passage. Plautus often notices the
way in which the husbands of monied

women were henpecked. See Asinaria v. 2.
46-48; and especiallya famous passage in

 

the Aulularia, Act iii. Scene 5, where he
descants on the advantages of marrying a
poor girl, if you can afford it. The whole
scene is excellent. The following lines
su'm up the whole question:

“ Hae sunt atque aliae multae in maguis
Indgghlldditates sumtusque intolerabiles.
Nam quae indotata est ea in potestate est
Ddtidime mactant et malo et damno viros!

(vv. 59—62.) '

23. Defetiscar mque adeo πρυ-ἰνίον]
⁴ Nor shall I be weary of trying to the very
last moment, till I have managed sor you
what Ι have promis sed. ' From its original
sense of‘ to open with chinks,' ‘to guel
as applied to wood, ‘fatiscor' pasees into
the general sense of‘ to give way. ' com-
pare the uses of χαὶνω. From‘ defetiscorss
which does not occur elsewhere, we have
the common participle ‘defessus’ ‘Hie
reading of the text is based upon two quota·

tions of Priscian. pp. 889 and' 1147, and γ

was first adopted by Bentley. , For ‘effecero'
see note on Heaut. ii. 3. 81. ‘Quod pel-
licitus sum' refers to the previous under—
standing between the two old men that the
cousins should marry.

Acr IV. Scmm 11. Geta has now seen
Phormio. ¹ There never was a more iutel-
ligent man. He understoodthe plan be·
fore he had told him half of it, and went.
off at once to look for Demipho, that he
might carry out his part in the' plot which
was to be practised on him. He was de-
lighted to have an opportunity of serviug
Phaedria as well as Antipho.' At this mo-
ment he sees Demipho and chremes com-
