a continuation of the measure. Bentley lays down the rule that
trochaic octonarii are always followed by trochaic verses, trochaic sep-
tenarii by iambic. Hermann (Epitome Doctrinae Metricae, ἓ 186)
prefers the statement, that a verse ending with an arsis (accented
syllable) is followed by an iambic verse; a verse ending in a thesis
(unaccented syllable) by a trochaic verse. This continuation of metre
is also extended to the final syllables of verses, so that some lines, which
appear to be hypermetrical‚ run into the following line, the two lines
being treated as one, and the last foot of the first line having therefore

the same measure as any other foot in the line. The following is an
instance:

“Ego de me facilo conjecturlam. Nemo est meorlum amicorum
kodlie
Apud quem exprom Ι ere omnia ΙΙ mea occulta, Cliltipho 5udeam.”
(Heaut. iii. 3. 13, 14.)

The same continuation occurs in some cases when the first syllable of a
line is connected by Synaloepha with the last syllable of the preceding
line; and in many instances this continuation of metre removes some
of the irregularities which annoy critics under the shape of shortened
syllables. Thus we may in the following lines consider ‘ et’ to coalesce
with ‘ modo :’

“Sed epistolam ab eo allatam esse audivi modo,
Et ad portitores esse delatam; hanc petam.’'
(Phorm. i. 3. 99, 100.)

The clausulae are often connected metrically with the lines which
they follow or precede, so as to form one regular verse if taken with one
of the segments of the next line, as in Eunuchus ii. 1. 2 ε

“ Fiet, at malture fiet Ι Satine hoc mandatlum est tibi? Ah
Rogitare quasi Ι difficile sit.”
We might arrange these lines thus:
“satine hoc mandatlum est tibi? Ah, rogitlfire, quasi diflficile
sit.”
Sometimes they are not connected, as in
“ Quid ais? quum intelllexeras
I‘d consilium Ι capere, cur non Ι dixti extemplo Pamphilo Ρ ”
(And. iii. 2. 37.)
