AOTUS QUINTI SCENA QUARTA.

DEMEA.

Nunquam ita quisquam bene subducta ratione ad vitam fuit
Quin res, aetas, usus semper aliquid apportet novi,

Aliquid moneat ; ut illa quae te scire credas nescias,
Et quae tibi putaris prima in experiendo repudies :
Quod nunc mihi evenit3 nam ego vitam duram quam vixi

usque adhuc

Prope jam excurso spatio mitto.

repperi

Id quamobrem Ρ Re ips}

Facilitate nihil esse homini melius neque clementia.
Id esse verum ex me atque ex fratre cuivis facile est noscere.
Ille suam semper egit vitam in otio, in conviviis,

Ac'r V. Scmm IV. Demea soliloquizes
on the state of feeling that exists between
himself and his children. He finds that it is
never too late to change. Up to this moment
he has lived a severe life, which he now in-
tends to abandon. And why? Because he
finds by comparing himself with his brother,
that the easy life is productive of more hap-

piness in the long run. His sons avoid him, u

and love their uncle. He will therefore see
whether he cannot beat his brother in his
own line; and as for the expense of the
plan, that does not so much matter at his
time of life.

The remainder of the play is not neces-
sary to the plot, and is a sort of after-picce.
The play would very well end with the last
scene, which is after the ordinary conclu-
sions of Terence’s plays. But still we may
easily conceive that Terence purposely in-

troduced these supplementary scenes as a
sort of set-off to the strong contrasts of
character in the former part os the play.
The design of this part is to show that in-
dulgence may easily be assumed, and thata
man is not to value himself too much upon
popularity obtained by mere easiness of
manner; for Demea, after outheroding
Herod, and astonishing even his brother by
his sudden fit of liberality, eventually an-
nounces his intention of striking the happy
medium for the future. The play thus
winds up with a common-sense moral. In
fact these remaining scenes may be said
to be the application and moral of the pre-
cedin .

Τὶιξ Metre is trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectic.

1. Bene subducta ratione ad vitamsuit]
¹ No one has ever balanced accounts for his
life so accurately but that circumstances,
age, and habit bring some change. and
suggest something new! For ‘ subducta
ratione ' compare Plautus, Captivi i. 2. 89:

‘⁴ Ibo intro, atque intus subducam ratiun-
culam.’' Curculio iii. 1 z

Beatus videor z subduxi ratiunculam
Quantum aeris mihi sit, quantumque
alieni sit‚’'

 

and note on ⁴ rationes puto ¹ above, ii. 1. 54.
Bentley alters ‘ fuit ’ into ⁴ fuat,' on the
ground that the present tense is required
by the rule of the sequence of tenses, other-
wise we should have had ‘apportaret,' ‘ mo-
neret.' But ¹ fuit ' is here frequentative;
and therefore it is followed by the present.
The whole sentence is merely the statement
of a general maxim, without any reference
to time. For ‘ repudies,' v. 4, see note on
Andria iv. 3. 18.

6. Prope jam excurso spatio] ‘I aban-
don the severe life which 1 have lived
hitherto, now that my course is almost run
out! Bentley objects to ‘excursa’ But
the common text is defended by Lachmann
on Lucretius iii. 1042. ‘Decurso spatio'

is more common. See Plautus, Mercator
iii- 2. 4:

‘⁴ Decurso in spatio, breve quod vitae reli-
quum est,

Voluptate, vino et amore delectam-03³

Cicero, Cato Major 23: ‘⁴ Nec vero velim

quasi decurso spatio ad carceres a calce
revocari.
