500 TERENOE AN D THE NEW OOMEDY.

suited to his audience. Rufinus (De Metris Com. p. 2707), quoted by
Meineke (Historia Critica, p. 444, 445), expressly says that the Latin
comedians preferred the longer measures of the Old Comedy to the
iambics of Menander. The whole question of Terence’s metres is dis-
cussed in the Introduction to this volume. Some have endeavoured to
bring the verse of Menander into the form of a tetrameter; but the
penultimate of φειδωλός forbids the change. Compare a similar instance
of change of metre by Plautus (Menand. Fab. Inc. Frag. xxxii. Meineke).

Χ Menander is known to have used trochaic tetrameters as well as iambic

trimeters (see Meineke, Hist. Crit. p. 442), but among all his frag-
ments I have found only one instance. See Fab. Incert. Fragm. xvii.
Mssiigggient viii. of Meineke (quoted in the note on Phormio ii. 3. 10)
is compared by him with Adelphi iii. 2. 55 :

“ N an'i hercle alius nemo respicit nos.’'

But the passage in the Phormio is quite as close. N either seems to
have any near connexion with it.

Other fragments os the *Αδελφοι are noticed by Meineke3 but none
of them have any close resemblance to the words of Terence.

HEOYRA.

This play is attributed to Apollodorus on the authority of the
Didascalia to the ‘ Hecyra' of Terence. It may, however, be doubted
whether the authority of this inscription (for there is also the reading
“Menandru’) is sufficient to settle the question. Meineke determines
it for Apollodorus, and for Apollodorus of Carystus in preference 10
Apollodorus of Gela, on the evidence of a certain anonymous biographer
of Terence edited by Mai. See his Historica Critica, pp. 462, 463.
But whether this play is Menander’s, or belongs to either of the Apol-
lodori, it is known only by the quotations of Donatus in his com·
mentary on the ‘ Hecyra' of Terence. The Ἐπιτρέποντες of Menander
appears to have been a very similar play, so nearly resembling the
‘Hecyra’ that it could be read with it. See the passage of Sidonius
quoted by Meineke, Fragm. Poet. Comoediae Novae, pp. 118, 119.
From Donatus we gathcr the following brief notices of 1116Ἑκύρα of
Apollodorus:

I. Ὀλίγαις ἐραστὴς ’γέγον’ ἑταίραις, ὦ Σύρα,
βέβαιος.
