 

TERENOE AND THE NEW COMEDY. 505

Of the ‘ Hecyra ’ and ‘ Epidicazomenos ’ of Apollodorus we know very
little. In his commentary upon the ‘ Phormio’ Donatus notices one or
two slight discrepancies (see note on i. 2. 42); affecting merely words
or minor incidente.

From this consideration of the points of resemblance and differ-
ence between Terence and the Greek writers of the New Comedy,

1 now pass to some general conclusione which arise from the foregoing -

comparison. .

We can hardly doubt that in the time of Terence, and from a much
earlier period, as is shown in the similar case of Plautus, the works of
the Greek dramatists were generally known and popular at Rome.
There was no doubt a large party among the literary public, if indeed
all the litei-ary men were not of this class, who looked to Greece as
their mistress in literature as well as in philosophy. The taste for, and
knowledge of, the Greek originale, was in Terence’s time generally
diffused, and many Greek plays were probably well known before they
had been reproduced in a Latin form. We have seen in the case of the
⁸ Phormio’ that that play was probably familiar to the Roman public
before it was produced on the Roman Stage by Terence (see note on
Prolog. v. 26); and the same fact appears in the constant quotations
of the Greek plays by Cicero and other authors. The Romans
affected to admire the translations of their own countrymen above the
originals from which they copied. Some, indeed, of them, who had paid
a more earesul attention to the comparative merits of the rival nations
as authors and poete, have had the candour to acknowledge that the
Greeks sur-passed in delicacy of language, and in refinement of wit, the
compositions of their most successful followcrs3 and that the best parts
of Terence seemed flat and insipid when compared with tho clear
diction and sparkling wit of Menander. But, without endeavouring to
discriminate between the rival claime of the foreign and native schools,
we may conclude that the knowledge of the Greek drama, and more
particularly here of the New Comedy, was widely diffused among tho
liter-ary men of Rome during the lifetime of our author. Terence had
not to create a taste for the Greek drama. He found it in existence3
and he limited himself to the skilful reproduction of the best models os
that literature.

And as this taste for Greek literature was widely diffused, so we
may feel sure that the Romans bad the advantage of posscssing in their
integrity those works of Philemon, Menander, Diphilus, Apollodorus,
and others, of which we ean gain only a faint conception from thc study
