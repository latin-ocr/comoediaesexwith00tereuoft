Nec pol me multum fallit quin quod suspicor sit quod velit.
La. Videndum est ne minus propter iram hanc impetrem

quam possiem3

Aut ne quid faciam plus quod post me minus fecisse satius

Agsgtrediar. Bacchis, salve.
Ba. Salve, Lache.
Bacchis,

La. Aedepol credo te nonnihil mirari,

Quid sit quapropter te huc foras puerum evocare jussi.
Ba. Ego pol quoque etiam timida sum, quum venit mihi in

mentem quae sim,

Ne nomen mihi quaesti obsiet ; nam mores facile tutor.
La. Si vera dicis, nihil tibi est a me pericli, mulier3 10
Nam aetate jam ea sum ut non siet peccato mihi ignosci

aequum :

3. Videndum est ἅνω] 4 Ι must take care
that Ι do not obtain less than 1 might on
account of my anger.¹ ⁴ Iram hanc ’ is 4 my
anger,’ ⁴ the anger which I now feel at my
son’s separation from his wife! This would
not be worth notice, were it not that Bentley
has altered ‘hanc ' (which he considers un-
meaning) into ⁴ hinc ' for ‘ ab hac Bac-
chide ;' an entirely gratuitous change.
Laches is anxious to conciliate Bacchis,
although he considers her to be the cause of
all the mischief. Donatus remarks upon
Terence’s skill in making the characters in
this scene perfectly natural, while he de-
viates from the ordinary treatment of such
characters: 44 Rarus vitae color in hac locu-
tione miscetur a poeta. Nam meretrix
loquitur et senex: et, quod est mirabilius,
bona meretrix mitis senex: ut intelligas
laborasse Terentium nt et a lege comicorum
recederet, et in actu tantum consuetudinem
retineret.'’ In the following line 4 minus
fecisse’ is equivalent to ‘ non fecisse.⁷
‘ Satius ' is very common in all authors.

5.] These and the two following lines
are arranged according to the Bembine
manuscript. In scauning v. 6, the learner
must remember that ⁴ Aedepol' is pro-
nounced as a dissyllable.

8. Venit in mentem] See note on Eu-
nuchus iv. 3. 24.

9. Ne nomen mihi quaesti obeiet] The
old text was ‘Ne nomen mihi quaestus
obstet apud te! But the words ‘apud te '
are omitted from the Bembinus‚ Vati-
canus, and Victorinum 'and the Bembine
has 4 quaesti! Hence Faern, followed by
Bentley, arranged the textas it now stands.

For the form ‘ quaesti ’ see below, Scene 3,
38: note on Eunuchus iii. 4. 4.

Nam morea facile tutor] ‘All that 1
fear is that the name of my profession will
be against me3 for I can easily defend my

conduct! Perlet compares Adelphi ii.

l.7:

“Leno ego sum. Aes. Scio. Sa. At ita
ut usquam fuit fide quisquam optima ;”

and below, Scene 3, 38, where Bacchis
{Regalis of her general good moral con-

“ Nunquam animum quaesti grafia ad
malas adducam partes,
Ego dum illo licitum est usa sum benigno
et lepido et comi.”

11. Nam aetate jam . . . . ut non εἰεί
peccato mihi iqnosei aequum] ‘ For 1 am
now at that time of life when 1 have no
right to expect to have a fault overlooked;
and 1 therefore am more camful in every
thing and more cautious not toactatmndom·
The commentators have been anxious to find
a recondite meaning in these words, and that
not the most innocent; but Laches simply
means, ⁴ An old man cannot afford to make
mistakes like a young man! As for the
construction, which Donatus considers am-
biguous, and which some commentatore
try to explain by calling ‘ peccato' an abla-
tive absolute, some by consider-ing it to be
put for 4 peccanti,' there is no difficulty, if we
only remember that ‘ignosco’ is used both
with a dative of the thing and a dative ofthe
mmm fga-0„ .,,
