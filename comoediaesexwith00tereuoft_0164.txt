ACTUS PRIMI SCENA SECUNDA.

THAIS.

PHAEDRIA.

PARMENO.

ΤΙι. Miseram mel vereor ne illud gravius Phaedria
Tulerit‚ neve aliorsum atque ego feci acceperit,

Quod heri intromissus non est.
Tremo horreoque postquam aspexi hanc.

Ph..

Totus Parmeno
Pa. Bono animo es:

Accede ad ignem hunc ; jam calesces plus satis, 5
Th. Quis hic loquitur ⁶? ehem, tune hic eras, mi Phaedria Ρ
Quid hic stabas? cur non recta introibas ΪΡ Pa. Caeterum

De exclusione verbum nullum. Th.. Quid taces Ρ

Ph. Sane quia vero hae mihi patent semper fores,

Aut quia sum apud te primus.

Th. Missa istaec face. lo

Ph. Quid missa? o Thais, Thais, utinam esset mihi
Pars aequa amoris tecum, ac pariter fieret,

Ut aut hoc tibi doleret itidem ut mihi dolet,
Aut ego istuc abs te factum nihili penderem.

 

Prima putatur

Hostia sus memisse mori, quia semina
pando

Eruerit rostro, spemque interceperit
anni!

But we do not require a metaphor to ex-
plain the word in this place.

Ac'r Ι. Scan II. Thais appears lament-
ing that Phaedria had misunderstood her
conduct. She chides him for his delay,
and eventually comes to an explanation
with him. She accounts for her previous
conduct by her anxiety to obtain possession
of the girl whom Thraso has promised her,
whose story she tells, with her suspicions oi*
her parentage. She requests Phaedria to
help her by absenting himself for two days
in the country. At first he suspects a
trick‚ but at last consents.

Metre; iambic trimeter.

l. Miseram me] ‘Me ' is here an en-
clitic. Compare Plautus, Trin. ii. 4. 50:
“ Mearum me rerum novisse aequum est or-
dinem. ” See notes on Andriai. 3. 15, and
Hecyrai.2. 119.

2. Aliorsum atque eqo feci acceperit]

Ἰ am afraid that Phaedria has taken it
otherwise than 1 intended.' For this use of

‘accipio' see Andria ii. 2. 30: “Νο11 recte
accipis, '’ and Heaut. ii. 3. 23: “Clinia,
aliter tuum amorem atque est accipis?

‘I tremble and
‘'Hor-reo

4. Tremo horreoque]
shudder all over on seeing her!
is commonly used in the sense of‘ to shiver
from coldl ySo Ovid, De Arte Am. ii. 213:

“ Saepe etiam dominae, quamvis horrebis et
1 se,

Alglentis manus est calfacienda sinu.'¹
Juvenal, Sat. i. 93: “Hori-enti tunicam
non reddere servo.'' Hence we have Par-
meno’s joke in the next line, “ Accede ad
ignem huno, jam calesces plus satis :⁹¹ cvi-
dently punning on the word ‘ ignis‚’ which
is applied in a thousand places to a lover.
Eugraphius in his note on this passage
imagines Parmeno to point to an altar of
Venus standing at Thais’ door. But this
seems unnecessary, though courtezans from
the days of Herodotus downwards sacrificed
to Venus. Parmeno meanS, ‘Go to your
mistress, and you will soon be warm enough
and to spare.'

7. Caeterum De exclusione verbum nul-
lum] ⁴ Howevers you see she says not a
word about having shut you out.' Parmeno
suggests this to Phaedria, to keep up the
misunderstanding between him and his mis-
tress3 and accordingly Phaedria meets her
first advances very ungraciously.

12. Pars aequa amoris] ‘would that
we fairly went shares in love, and that we
were alike in our feelings, for then either
you would be pained at my pain, or I
should not lay your conduct to heart,know-
ing that you were acting against your feel·

ings.’ ‘ Dolet’ is sometimes used imper-
sonally with the dative case, as in Adelphi
ii. 4. 8. “Hoc mihi doletss' and in this

play, iii. l. 40, absolutely “Dolet dictum
imprudenti adiilescenti.'’ ’See also Plautus,
Captivi· 1. 2. 49· . ‘Huic illud dolet.”
