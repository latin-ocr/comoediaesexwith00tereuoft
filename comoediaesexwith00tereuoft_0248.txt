25. Homo sum . . . puto] ‘ 1 818 8 1888,
and I consider nothing that belongs to 81811
foreign to me.' ‘In that Ι am 8 man, Ι
make the affairs of mankind my own.’ This
famous passage is alluded to several times
by Cicero ;—in De Officiis i. 9, where he
merely quotes it with the preface: ‘⁴ Diffi-
cilis cura rerum alienarum ;’' in De Legibus
12 ε “ Quod si quomodo est natura sic judi-
cio homines ‘humani,’ ut ait poeta, ⁴ nihil a
se alienum 1181818817,ἱ coleretur jus aeque
ab hominibus :” and De Finibus iii. 19
(63): ‘⁴ Ex hoc nascitur etiam ut communis
hominum inter homines naturalis sit com—
mendatio ut oporteat hominem ab homine,
ob id ipsum quod homo sit, non alienum
videri.” ‘ Humanum' of course refers not
to the frailties of humanity, as is commonly
supposed by those who quote this verse,
but to the incidents of human life; the
good and evil which may befal our neigh-
bour. The idea is the stoical one of an
universal society of mankind, that ·‘ One
touch of nature makes the whole world kin.''
It would be endless to notice later writers
who have quoted or adopted this line.
Cowper has expanded the idea very finely:

“ What’s the world to you ?

 

a Much. Ι was born of woman and drew-

milk
As sweet as charity from human breasts.
1 think, articulate, I laugh and weep,
And exercise all fonctions of a man.
How then should 1 and any' man that lives
Be strangers to each other ?''
The 'rask—The Garden, 195—201.

26. Vel me monere . . ⁷. te ut deterream]
⁴ Suppose me to give you this advice, or to
ask you this question. It is right, then let
me do it: it is not right, then let me dis-
suade you from it? ’ Deterreo ' is similarly
used in Adelphi i. 2. 64: ‘⁴ Adversor sedulo
et deterreo.'’ Plautus, Miles Gloriosus ii.

3. 61:

“ Μ8 nemo homo deterruerit quin 88 sitin ·
his aedibus.⁷'

ro} 11ὲῖ form of the sentence compare Eun.
u. . z

‘¹ Negat quis ? nego z ait? aio.’'

28. Milli eie est usus] ‘ I am obliged to
do so.' ‘ Usus est’ is frequently used for
⁴ opus est.¹ Compare Adelphi iii. 3. 752
‘⁴ Et moneo quid facto usus siet ;'’ and
Hecyra iii. 1. 47. similarly the phrase
¹ usus venit,’ ⁴ it becomes necessary,’ which
occurs frequently. See iii. 2. 42-46.
Adelphi v. 6. 7 1 “ Tibi, ob eam rem si quid
usus venerit, Libens bene faxim.” Phormio
i. 2. 23:

“ -- Ο Geta, provinciam
Cepisti duram. Ge. Mi usus venit, hoo
scio.”

Cicero, De Finibus v. 10, quotes this line
from the Heautontimorumenos, but rather
differently:

‘⁸ Missfi sic usus est: tibi ut opus est facto,
888. ’

This variety does not affect the sense or the
metre, and it may be easily accounted for
as occurring in a quotation from memory.

30. Si quid laboris· est, nollem] ‘lfit
were merely a question of work, Ι should be
unwilling to interfere with yon} but teli
me, I pmy, what trouble is on your mind?
what have you done to yourself to deservo
such punishment ?' This line has been eon-
sidered spurious by some critice who have
despair-ed of finding 8 meaning in it3 but
the sense seems plain enough. Chremes
means, ¹ Ι should not say a word if 1
thought that you worked merely as 8 whim3
but Ι 818 sure there is 80188 trouble at tho
bottom of it, and if you will only impartit ·
to me, I will help you by every means in
my power!
