‘tumulti’ in the following line compare

e business which keeps him out of the way
for a longer time.

Acr- 111. Senta 111. Pamphilus now
gives vent ιο his feelings. and recounts the
circumstances of his visit to his wife. When
he arrived he soon found that he was unex-
peetod, and at the moment unwelcome. He
no sooner entered his wife’s room than he
diseovered what was the reel nature of her
illnees; and he retired at once, in amase·
ment at the disgrsoeful event. He was
followed by his mother-in-law, who ex-
plained to him that her daughter had been
wronged by some unknown person before
her marriage to him, and that she had lest
his mother· house that her present state
might be concealed from all her husband's
family. She entreated him to conceal the
event from ever-y one; and to act towards
her as he thought due to himself. No one
else should be allowed ιο have any suspi-
cion of the real state of the ease. This
promise Pamphilus had giren. and he is
now distracted by his misfortnne; for he
cannot think of taking her διεὶς while ιι
the same time he is strongly attached to
her: and he cannot hear to think of the
solitudo and nnhappiness of his future life,
Stin. as he formerly disengaged himself
from his love that he might attach himself
to his wife. so he must now exerciae the
same constraint on himself. Parmeno at
all eventa. who is now returning. must ha

oover what ls going on.
