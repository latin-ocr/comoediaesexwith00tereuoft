picture os the parasite in Act ii. scene 2,
ιο here we have the b ocio drawn
to the life. Thraso and Gnatho come
οιι the stage talking about the present
whichThrasohassenttoThais. ‘Was
she much obliged ‚³⁹ says Thraso. ‘Im-
meusely,¹ replies his friend· and so he
leads him on to give an account of his great
servim with the king of Persia, and of the

and oves-powering manner in which

m put down certain rivals. Gnatho

then advises him to keep Thais in astate
ol jealousy about Pamphila, as the best
means of keeping Phaedria out of the field.
The mette is iambic trimeter.
1. Cicero in his treatise De Amicitia
ly alludes to the characters of
and Gnatho. In the twenty—sixth
he quotes this line: ⁰⁸ Nulla est igi-
mr amicitia quum alter verum audire
aon vult, alter ad mentiendum paratus est.
Nee parasitorum in comoediis assentatio
faeata videretur, nisi esseut milites gloriosi·

that account: Compare v. 7. 42 “Nunc

is often thus used with words expressing joy,
sorrow, or desire. Compare Andria ii. 3.

in other passages of Terence in the sense

v.1.61.1t is almost unnecessary to
observo that many of Gnatho' s remarks are
made half aeide, so that Thraso may hear
only what is coinplimentary' ιιι them. At
the same time Thraso’ s character-¹ ιιι that of
a man who would not very easily perceive
satire, and whose good opinion of himself
would make him take it all in a compli-
mentary unse.

themselves ιιι settling which king of Persia is

meant, because he was king in the time of
Menander. Madame Dacier on the con-

maintalns that it is not a kin os
Persia at all. because in this nme play -
rhus is mentioned (iv. 7. 13). and thinks
that Seleucus is intended. We might as
well attem to identify all the princes men-
tioned in ginakespw e 's Co¹medies. Kings
