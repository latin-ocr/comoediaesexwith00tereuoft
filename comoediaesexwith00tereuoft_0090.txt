1 6 AN DRIA.

In ignem posita est : fletur.

Interea haec soror

Quam dixi ad flammam accessit imprudentius,

Satis cum periclo.

Ibi tum exanimatus Pamphilus

Bene dissimulatum amorem et celatum indicat. 105
Accurrit: mediam mulierem complectitur:

Mea Glycerium, inquit, quid agis? cur te is perditum Ρ

Τ11111 1113, ut consuetum facile amorem cerneres,

Rejecit se in eum flens quam familiariter.

So. Quid ais? Si. Redeo inde iratus atque aegre ferens. 110

N ec satis ad objurgandum causae.

Diceret,

‘ Quid feci Ρ quid commerui aut peccavi pater Ρ
Quae sese 111 ignem injicere voluit, prohibui,

Servavi.’

Honesta oratio est.

So. Recte putas.

Nam si illum objurges vitae qui auxilium tulit, 115
Quid facias illi qui dederit damnum aut malum ⁴?

Si. Venit Chremes postridie ad me clamitans,

Indignum facinus3 comperisse Pamphilum

Pro uxore habere hanc peregrinam. Ego illud sedulo

Negare factum 3 ille instat factum z denique 120
Ita tum discedo ab illo, ut qui se filiam

Greek. It 13 3 matter of doubt when the
practice of burning was introduced into

ζημίαν“ η aeax6u3 which' 1s evidently corrupt.
The line probably ran thus, {occimpy being re-

Rome. Some say not till the death of jected as an obvious gloss, τί ἄν ποιήσαις

Sulla (see Dict. of Ant.,) but the passage
of Cicero (De Legibus ii. 23) generally
quoted seems rather to show that burning was
in use before the era of the XII Tables.

109. Quam familiariter] ‘Quam’is used
with adverbs of the positive degree to en-
hance their meaning. Thus, “Somnium
quam simile somniavit,’' Plaut. Miles Glo-
riosus ii. 4. 47. ‘¹ Sicut palmae rami quam
late diffunduntur,” Caesar, Bell. Gall. vi. 26;
though here another reading is ¹ palmae
ramique late!

114. Honesta oratio eet]
ment is a specious one.' Compare Livy i.
4: “Quia deus auctor culpae honestior
erat ;'’ ‘because it was more respectable
to attribute her frailty to a deity!

116. Dederit damnum aut malum]
‘Damnum dare' is the usual Latin of the
old jurisconsults, for which ‘damnum
facere' is sometimes found less elegantly.
‘ Damnum ’ properly corresponds to ζημία,
⁴ malum’ to κακόνς the former signifies the
loss or injury; the latter, the motive‚ the
crime. ⁴ Damnum,' or ⁴ dampnum,' origi-
nally signified ‘that which is taken away ’
from a person. The commentators quote
from Priscian the original of this line, τί
ἂν ποιήσαις ἐκείνῳ ὃς ἄρα δεδωκὼς ἦ

‘ The argu-

ὃς ἄρα ζημίαν η κακὸν εἴη δεδωκώς, These
grammarians must often have quoted from
memory, and badly too.

119. Sedulo]
Perlet quotes an old gloss on this passage
which gives ἀδόλως, ‘ with sincerity! But
this is hardly the meaning here. In
other passages we have the more general
meaning, ‘ diligently,' ‘ earnestly.’ Com-
pare iii. 5. 8: “Atque id ago sedulo ;'' and
iv. l. 54 e ‘⁴ Parum succedit quod ago: at
facio sedu10‚'’ meaning ‘ and yet 1 am not
to blame, Ι have done my best! In Hecyra
iv. 2. 2, “ Etsi ea dissimulas sedulo,'' the
sense is rather ⁶ purposely‚' as in Eunuchus
i. 2. 58, “Fingit causas ne det sedulo.” Com-
pare also Phormio ii. 3. 81, and Adelphi
i. 2. 64. The etymology of the word is
disputed. Some give the derivation ‘ sedes‚'
which seems to be adopted by Forcellini
Dr. Donaldson derives it from

(sedulus).
‘se dolo,' which may be compared with
the Greek ἀτεχνῶς. Τ110 original mean-
ing of ‘dolus' was simply “devicess and
when a bad sense was required the epithet
‘malus ’ was added, as iu Eun. iii. 3. 9, to
signify ‘ treacherously' (see Macleane on
Horace, Carm. i. 3. 28).
