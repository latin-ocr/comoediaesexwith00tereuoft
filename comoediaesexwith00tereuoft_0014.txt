viii PREFAOE.

osten a simple paraphrase of the author' s words; and for purposes
of criticism it is nearly worthless.

CALPURNms supplies the place of Donatus on the‘ Heautontimo-
rumenos.' He seems to have imitated the manner of Donatus3
and in many places to have copied from him. He cannot be

considered of much value.

BENTLEY’S Editions (1726, 1727) were an era in Terentian ,

criticism. The real value of his labours lies in the attention

” which he paid to the metres of Terence. This Ι have treated of

fuJJy 111 the Introduction. Even in this point he seems to have

, been led away by the love of correction, and to have introduced into

the versification of Terence a greater licence and more variety than
was necessary. His notes, it is unnecessary to say, abound in conjec-
tural readings. These I have very rarely had occasion to adopt.
In general nothing but authority should lead an editor to depart
from the acknowledged reading of the best manuscripts. There is
another defect in Bentley which makes him a bad mitid—his
extremely literal turn of mind. As in Horace he was “ misled
by want of ear and poetical taste‚'' so in Terence he seems to have
laboured under an absolute incapacity of understanding a joke3
and his criticisms are in consequence often amusing from the con-
trast of his dry and literal captiousness with the quiet humour of
the passage which 110 is criticizing ³.

The text in this edition is that of Zeune’s edition as brought out
by Giles (London‚ 1837). Wheresoever Ι have deviated from it
Ι have given the reason in my notes ; but it will be found that I
have done more towards maintaining the old text than for any
innovations. This edition of Zeune's Terence is the best of all the
books that I have used. It contains all the comments of Donatus,
Eugraphius, Calpurnius, Bentley, and Ζο11110, and though not of
