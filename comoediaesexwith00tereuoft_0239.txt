humiliation3 but is ultimately received into favour by his father upon
his promising to settle and lead a respectable life.

This play is remarkable for a supposed irregularity in i-ts construction,
which has made it the subject of an animated controversy among advo-
cates of the ‘ Unities! It is clear that the opening scene of the play is
laid at evening, when Menedemus is just finishing his day’s work. The
Third Act commences with the following morning, and in the interval
the supper at Chremes’ house takes place. This in itself, though an
exception to the general arrangement of Terence's playa, is not a very
important matter. The theory of the ‘ Unities ’ is not to be received as
an absolute law for the Drama: aud there is nothing in this case which
is not abundantly justified by many other instances. Upon this point

turns a theory which was first mooted by Scaliger, and afterwards main-

tained by Madame Dacier,——that this play was acted in two portione:
the first two Acts at night, after sunset3 and the three remaining Acts
the next morning at break of day; the interval between the two parts
being taken up with the supper at Chremes‘ house. This idea proceeds
entirely upon the supposed necessity of filling up the interval between
the Second and Third Acts ; and is, as far as we are informed, entirely
gratuitous. Colman has shown the absurdity os the idea very well in
his remarks on this subject. Any one who considers that the Roman
Drama was performed in the open air, will at once see the improbability
of such a mode of representation. The Roman Amphitheatre was at
any time a disadvantageous arena for the Drama. What must have been
the success of a play, acted partly at night-fall, partly before breakfast
next morning? Nothing but a devotion to the ‘ Unities ' could have led
to ench an idea ; and it will be dismissed without any further discussion,

Ἰχ now that a more artistic idea of Dramatic Unity is generally recognized.
