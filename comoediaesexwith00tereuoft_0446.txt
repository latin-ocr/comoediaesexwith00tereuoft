Neque detractum ei est quicquam qm· posset post nosci qui siet.

Simul vereor Pamphilum, ne orata nostra nequeat diutius

PAMPHILUS.

So. Non clam me est, nate mi, tibi me esse suspectam uxorem

tuam

Propter meos mores hino abisse, etsi ea dissimulas sedulo.
Verum, ita me Di ament, itaque obtingant ex te quae exopto

mihi,

Ut nunquam sciens commerui merito ut caperet odium illa
mei;

Teque ante quam me amare rebar ei rei firmasti fidem. 5

Nam mihi intus tuus pater narravit modo quo pacto me habu-

eris

pare Plautus, Persa ii. 2. 12: “Nec sub-
igi queantur unquam.'’ Rudens iv. 4. 20:

⁴⁵ Ut nequitur comprimi!” Lucretius i.
1042, 1043 ε

“Cudere enim crebro possunt partemque
moran
Dum veniant aliae ac suppleri summa
queatur!

Sallust also has ‘ nequitur ' Jugurtha, c. 31 :
‘⁴ Quicquid sine sanguine civium ulcisci
nequitur jure sactum sit.’'

The analogous
form ⁴

potestur' occurs in Lucretius iii.
1023 (1010 Lachmann): “Quod tamen
expleri nulla ratione potestur.” Τ118 forms
‘ possitur' and ‘ possuntur ’ are also re-
corded. See Forcellini, ‘ Possum!

Acr IV. Scnnn ΙΙ. Sostrata has heard
from her husband that Pamphilus has de-
termined not to take back his wife, but to
be separated from her rather than from his
mother. She has decided on her part not
to allow his affection for her to separate
him from Philumena3 and she now tells
him that she has made up her mind to
retire* to their country house, that Philu-
mena may return to him. Pamphilus does
not receive the proposal favourably, in
spite of her renewed arguments in favour of
her decision. This step of hers would de-
prive him of any excuse for separation from
his wife. She is therefore unable to per-

suade him to accept her proposal.

The Metre is iambic tetrameter.

4. Commerui] See note on iii. 5. 36.

5. Teque ante quam] The common text
has ‘quam‚' but Bentley reads from one
of the oldest English manuscripts ‘ quod-⁹
Donatus, however, says ‘⁸ Deest tam,' evi-
dently considering it as an antithesis to
⁴ quam! Whichever reading we adopt, and
1 have preferred to keep ‘ quam ’ as sup-
ported by the great majority of good autho-
rities, the sense is the same. ‘As I au
along thought that you loved me, so now
you have confirmed my opinion.' ‘ Ei rei'
is 8 mere paraphrase, referring to the whole
preceding clause. ‘Firmare fidem' varies
in meaning with the sense of ‘fides' In
Andria iii. l. 4 ε “ Sed hic Pamphilus—fir-
mavit fidem,'' it means ⁴ has firmly pledged
his saith) In the text ‘fides’ has the
sense of ‘belief,' and in v. l. 23, where
Bacchis says ε

“Aliud si scirem qui fimare meam apud
vos possem fidem
Sanctius quam jusjurandum, id pollicet-ex!¹
tibi.''
The meaning is, ⁴ If I knew any way in
which to pledge you my word of honour
more sacredly than by 811 oath.' For the
variety of meaning in ‘ fides ' see Forcellini3
and notes on Andria iii. 4. 73 iv. l. 19.
6. Quo pacto me habueris praepon’tam]
