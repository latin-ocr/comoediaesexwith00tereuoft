quote from Menander τὸ γὰρ τρέφον με

land, of which he thus speaks. See Me·
nander's ’Δλιεῖς, viii. (Meineke.)

In this scene, as Donatus observes.
Terence gives us a parasite of the good old
school3 one who makes his dinner his chief
concern, and is found at his patron's table
always in the best of spirits, with an un-
bounded capacity for enjoying the good
things that he finds there. Donatus tells
us that when this play was being privately
rehearaed‚ Ambivius‚ the actor of the part
of Phormio, came in innoxiam, and began
to act this scene. And as soon as Terence
had heard the first lines spoken in the
drunken manner in which he uttaered them,
he exclaimed that that was exactly the idea
which he had before him of the character
of Phormio. In the Eunuchus, as we have
seen, he gave a specimen of a more relined

ffecies of the nme genus. See note on
unuchus ii. 2. 1³.

of obvious meaning: and that ‘ludere ¹ was

every word ln this way. The general mean·

amesa tha ffleads whom he had pm-
cured tc his iutoeview with Phor-
mioz andtoadvisswithhimoa the lineof

conduct which ought to be pursued. Geta
and Phormio continue their conversation,
so that he shall overhear them. Phormio
accuses Demipho of meanness. ‘Because
this Phanium is poor, he pretends not to
recollect her father. It was all very ex·
cusable in the young man3 but for the old
friend to disclaim his friend, simply because
he was poor, and that when there was not
a better man living—' Geta meanwhile de-
fends his master, and abusos Phormio
roundly. Demipho now joins them, aud a
conversation follows. Phormio is at first
rather taken unawares at being asked di-
rectly who this friend of his was, and for
a moment forgets his name3 but having
been prompted by Geta, he resumes the
attack. and accuses Demipho of neglecting
his old friend Stilpho, simply because he
did not leave any money behind him. He
refuses ω go into the whole question of
their relationship, which he has already done
before the judges. Demipho proposes that
Phormio shall take back Phanium, and
offers him live minae. Phemio refuses in-
dignantly ς advises Demipho tolet the mat-
ter rest3 and professing great friendliness‚
gives him some advice, warning him
at the nme time to take care-how he be-
haves to the young lady.
