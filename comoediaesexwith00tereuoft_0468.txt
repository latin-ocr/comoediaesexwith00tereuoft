35. Egone hunc ab Orco mortuum ?]
Parmeno is at his wit’s end to discover what
it can be that he has done to beuefit his
master so immensely. He begs Pamphilus
to ten him; but he refuses: and then he
recurs to the strong language which Pam-
philus had before used (v. 12). and repeats
it, as if —he hoped to extract the secret out
of the words. Tine situation is admirably
conceived‚ and we may easily imagine how
the idea would be spun out by a writer of
the Dickens' school.

37. Imo vero ecio] Pamphilus had
said, ⁶ You don't ‘know what good you have
done me, and out of what misery you have
dragged me! ‘Don't 1?’ says Parmeno.
‘ Yes Ι do; and 1 did not relieve you from
your misery without knowing it! This is a
mere brug of Parmeno's, as a last desperate
attempt to extract the secret from his mas-

ter. Bacchis retorts ironically, ‘ Can any
thing useful escape Parmeno .²' Poor Par-
meno is utterly baffied, and turning to the
spectators confesses that he has done more
good without knowing it, than he ever did
knowingly before. For ‘imprudens’ see
Eunuchus, Prol. 27, note. ‘ Imprudens’
and ‘insciens ’ are synonymous in the rol-
lowing passage of Plautus, which closely
resembles the text:

‘⁴ Reducemque faciet liberum in patriam ud
Imlgtdgssim itidem ut saepe jum in mul-
PliilsS liissigiens quis fecit quam prudens
