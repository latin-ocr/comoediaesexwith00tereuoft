Nisi aliquid video ne esse amicam hanc gnati resciscat senex,

Nam quod de argento sperem, aut posse postulem me fallere,
Nihil est: triumpho si licet me latere tecto abscedere. ⁵

aberit infortunium! This is 11811 in metre,
unless we are to read with Weise in the
Tauchnitz edition ‘ med.’ But this form is
not met with in Terence, and it is better to
read 4 permultum' with Bentley than to
adopt 88 obsolete form, or without reason
to imagine an hiatus in an unusual place.
Some commentators of the Dacier school
have supposed that Syrus has been present
at the recognition which has taken place in
doors: but there is nothing to lead us to
this idea. It is more natural to suppose
him to remain on the stage, and to make
his soliloquy here as his commentary on
what had transpired in the last scene.

2. Ita hac re in'anqustum oppido nunc
meae coquntur copiae] 4 8ο utterly are all
my resources brought to bay by this affair!
With the phrase ‘in angustum coguntur'
we may compare the expressions ‘venire in
angustum,' ‘deduci in angustum,' used by
Cicero. So 18 De Officiis 17 110 have “ Con-
cludi in angustum et exiguum.'' Τ110
idea is that of an army driven into 8
narrow place whence it cannot extricato
itself, and where it has no room sor ma-
noeuvring: but we need not press the me-
taphor as some literal persons mentioned
by Calpurnius, who adopted the reading

‘in angusto oppido 003881813 of which the
sense 15 801 better than the Latinity. ί-Ορ
. pido' is 8 very common word in Plautus,
and occurs in some few places 1n Terence.
Compare 11. 4. 12. Adelph1 111. 2. 24. Phor-
mio ii. 2. 3. It generally is used in an in-
tensive sense 85 ‘ 1811103 sometimes in
answers as 4188118103 See Plautus, Bac-
chides iv. 3. 43:

“ Mne. Perii. 072. Quid ita? Mne. Quia.
pah-i omne cnm ramento reddidi.

011. Reddisti? Mne. Reddidi. Ch. Om-
nene? Mne. Oppido. 011. 000151 58-

mus.”

The old derivation of Festus 4 Quantum vel
oppido satis esset' is sufficiently absurd.
Dr. Donaldson (Varronianus) maintains

that it is connected with ἐπιπέὸον, and
so 0011105 to have the meaning of ‘plane.’
Perlet quotes from Fabricius a Greek
proverb, of which this line is nearly a trans-
lation: είς στενὸν κομιδῇ αἱ δυνάμεις ἐμοὶ
καθίστανται.

5. Triumpho ei lieet me latere tecto ab·
scedere] 4 Ι am triumphant if 1 can only
escape 88118113 4 Latus nudum praebere'
was a gladiatorial term signifying ‘ to be
wounded! See Tibullus i. 4. 46 z

44 Saepe dabis nudum, vincat ut illa, latus ;''

but here there is a more natural allusion to
the ordinary punishment of slaves, 117 which
Syrus has a right to expect 4 latera 101083

with 8 whole skin.

6. Orus-ior, bolum . . . efaucibus] ¹ I am
disti-acted to think that such a nice mouth-
ful should have been snatched from my
mouth all of 8 sudden. ¹ ⁶ Bolus ’ is said to
be derived from the Greek βῶλος, 48 lump’
originally‘ of earth) This· 15 1110 only
sage in 11111011 11 occurs.1n Plautus pthe
word is 811187541101853 and is used 18 1110
chief senses, (1) a throw at dice, (2) 8 cast
of a net3 and then metaphorically, some-
times in the sense of 4 38183 sometimes

‘losa' See examples in Forcellini. Some
suppose the word to be the same 18 11115

rather 18 favour of the short -,o it may very
well be taken 18 the more general sense of
