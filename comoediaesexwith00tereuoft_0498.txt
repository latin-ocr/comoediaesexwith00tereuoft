424 PHORMIO.

“ Invitus feci: lex coegit ?'' Audio. Fateor. Ge. Places.

De. Verum scientem, tacitum, causam tradere adversariis;

Etiamne id lex coegit? Ph. Illud durum. Ge. Ego ex-
pediam: sine. >

De. Incertum est quid agam, quia praeter spem atque incre-
dibile hoc mihi obtigit :

Ita sum irritatus animum ut nequeam ad cogitandum insti-

tuere: 10
Quamobrem omnes, quum secundae res sunt maxime, tum
maxime

Meditari secum oportet quo pacto adversam aerumnam ferant3
Pei-iola, damna, exilia! Peregre rediens semper cogitet
Aut filii peccatum, aut uxoris mortem, aut morbum filiae3
Communia esse haec; nequid horum unquam accidat animo

novum :

already; think of something else.' Lach-
mann on Lucretius iii. 1050, maintains that
the speech is Phaedria's, and that we should
read ‘ atqui reperiam) He objects to the
form ⁴ repperi‚’ and for the same reason he
alters ‘repperis ¹ in i. 4. Ι, to ‘reperies'
But it matters not which way we spell the
word, the ictus of the metre will lengthen
the first syllable. ‘ Reperiam ’ is a possible
conjecture3 but the ordinary text gives the
best sense. It does not mean that an
excuse will be found; but that the excuse
is already found. They have settled what
line they are to take, see i. 4. 46-50. Nor
is it desirable to give the words to Phaedria.

He speaks only once, and then in a different
tone, till he steps forward (v. 24) to wel-

come his uncle; and Geta is represented
throughout the greater part of the scene, as
commenting aside, first on what Demipho

says, then on what passes between him and

Phaedria.

8. Illud durum] ‘That is a puzzlerl’
Phaedria sees that Demipho has hita blot
in their game; but Getap disposes of it at
once. ‘Durus' is frequently used in the
sense of‘ difficulty ‘3'hard as 111 the lines of

Horace:

“ Durum: sed levius fit patientia
Quicquid corrigere est nefas.''
(Carm. i. 24. 19, 20.)

ll. Quamobrem omnes] Cicero quotes
these words, together with some lines from
Euripides, in his Tusculan Disputations‚ iii.
14, with this preface, “Haec igitur prae-
meditatio futurorum inalorum lenit eorum
adventum, quae venientia longe antea vi-

15

deris.” He proceeds to translate Euri-
pides' lines, and ends by quoting this whole
speech of Demipho. The Greek lines
are taken from Euripidae’ Theseus, and
are as follows.

ἐ ὠ δὲ τοῦτο παρὰ σοφοῦ τινὸς μἀθὼν,
ειςλὲὣβῧῖτίδας νοῦν συμφοράς τ’ ἐβαλ-

φυγάς τ’ ἐμαυτῷ προστιθεὶς πάτρας
θαῖξὶᾏὶυς τ’ ἀώρους, και κακῶν αλλας
ο ους,

ἐν’ εἴ τι πάσχοιμ’ ὧν ἐδόξαζον φρενὶ
μὴ μοι νεωρὲς προσπεσὸν μᾶλλον δάκῃ.

They are also quoted by Galen and Plu-
tarch. See Poetae Sceniyci (Dindorf) Euri-
pides,Fragm.384.1t is characteristic of
the person, no doubt, as Colman has
observed‚ that Demipho, even when at the
height of his anger, is made to moralize in
this way; mainly also that an opportunity
may be given for the burlesque which Geta
gives of the words immediately afterwards.
Compare the parallel instance in Adelphi
iii. 3. 60-75.

15. Communia esse haee] ‘We should
remember that these things are common to
us all! 1f it is not in too grave a style for
the subject, though Demipho is purmely
made to talk gravely. we may compare
Tennyson’s beautiful turn of this idea:

“ That loss is common would not make
My own less bitter3 rather more:
Too common! never morning wore

To evening, but some heart did break.”

(In Memoriam, VI.)
