AOTUS QUARTI SOEN A QUARTA.

AESCHINU S.

Discrucior animi z

Hocine de improviso mali mihi objici
Tantum, ut neque quid de me faciam neque quid agam certum

siet !

Membra metu debilia sunt ; animus timore

Obstipuit : pectore consistere nil consili 5
Quit. Vah! quomodo me ex hac expediam turba? Tanta

nunc
Suspicio de me incidit 3

Neque ea immerito: Sostrata credit mihi me psaltriam hanc

emisse.
Id anus mihi indicium fecit.

Nam ut hinc forte ea ad obstetricem erat missa, ubi eam vidi

ilico

Accedo, rogito Pamphila quid agat, jam partus adsiet;

Ac'r IV. Scmm IV. Aeschinus comes‘

in in a great state of distress and alarm.
He is so distressed at the suspicions which
Sostrata and Pamphila have of him. He
has just found out what their feeling is
from the old woman who was sent for a
nurse. He does not know what to do
about the matter, for he cannot explain
himself without bringing his brother's name
forward. All this, 118 says, is in conse-
quence of his own folly. He should have
told his father from the first, and have
begged his consent to his marriage with
Pamphila. Now, however, at all events he
must clear himself, and so he proceeds to
knock at the door, when some 0118 sud-
ν ’ᾱ8111γ 8011188 out.

The Metre is as follows3 l, iambic mo-
nometer hypercatalectic; 2, cretio dimeter3
3. 6. 10. 17-27, trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectic; 4, 5, choriambic; 7, iambic dimeter;
8, trochaic tetrameter3 9, iambic dimeter
camacum 11— 16, iambic tetrameter.

The last line of this 888118 18 to be taken
with the first of the next scene to make
one troc-haic tetrameter catalectic.

These opening lines are arranged vari-
ously in editions. Zeuue's text here merely
follows old editions; and on a question
of metre their authority is not to be com-
pared to that of Bentley or Hermann. I
have followed on the whole Weise’s arrange-
ment in the Tauchnitz edition, which has

the merit of the greatest simplicity and the
closest adherence to the authorized text.
For an explanation of the various men-es
here as well as in other places the render is
referred to the Introduction.

l. Discrucior animi] ‘ I am tormented
in mind? For the genitive see note on
Eunuchus ii. 2. 43. Compare also Phormio
i. 4. 10: “Quum mihi pavm, tum-Anu·-
pho me excruciat animi.'' We have also
in Plautus, Miles Gloriosus iii. l. 125:
“ Continuo excruciarer animi.” Epidicus i.
2. 35: “Desipiebam mentis quum illas
scriptas mittebam tibi.''

3. Neque quid de me sociam] Three old
manuscripts quoted by Bentley have ⁸ de,’
as well as many old editions. It is requisito
for the metre3 and as both phrases ‘me
facere ’ and ‘ de me facere ’ are very com-
mon, it is likely enough that the preposition
Ἐἒὲιιὲξ ἷὲεέἒὲξ 161,ἷέῗῖαὲ 1320233? {332
that is 110 authority for the word.

6. Quomodo me ει· hac expediam tur-
ba?] Bentley adds ‘nescim' to make up
the line, which he begins with ‘quomodo.'
The word is merely oonjectural, and unne-
cessary, if we arrange the line as in the
text. But conjecture is certainly excusable
here if any where. The preceding line is
better without ⁴ quit,’ which Bentley gives
it. It now corresponds with v. 4. For
⁴ expediam ’ see Andria iii. 5. 11.
