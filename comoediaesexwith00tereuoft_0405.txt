N ovas qui exactas feci ut inveterascerent,

Ne cum poeta scriptura evanesceret. 5
In his quas primum Caecili didici novas

Partim sum earum exactus, partim vix steti.

Haut„ Prolog. v. 11. Plautus employs the
word once or twice in the more ersl sense
of ‘one who aske! See Poen us i. 2. 148,
und Stichus iii. 2. 38:

“Rp Hsud aequum est te inter oratores

But in both places there is sn allusion ιο
the more special sense. So here there may
be the sume play on the wordss more purti-
culsrly ss it would be importent to catch

6. Caecili] The position of Caecilius st
this'time ιι shown by the popular story
that when Terence brought his first play to
the sedilee he 1ιι referred to Caecilius
(see the Introduction). Horace distinguishes
between him und Terence ιιι ι well· known
line, Epist. ii. 1. 59.

“Viaee' Caecilius gravitate, Terentius

It is not clear, however, what he meent b

Ambivius formed the connecting link be-
tween the old popular poeti-y of Csecilius
sud the new poet whom he wss now bring-
ing into notice. It is clear from the manner
in which the older poet is spoken of here
thst he 1ιι now reckoned by the contem-
por-ries of Terence to hsve su established
reputation. ‘And y,⁹et esys the speaker, ·
