audience, and dismisses them. Horace in-
forms us that this was the common ending
of all plays: ‘⁴ Donec cantor, Vos plaudite,
dicat,'' Epist. ad Pisones 155. See Plautus,
Amphitryo ad flu-z “ Nunc, spectatores,
Jovis summi causa clare plaudite.” Τ11ε
mark Ω is 'generally prefixed to the word
‘ Plaudite,’ in old copies. Bentley consi—
ders it to be a corruption of cA, ‘ cantor!
It has been variously explained, by some
as put for Ὠὃὸς, ‘cantor ς’ by others as
equivalent to ὅλος ὄχλος. The Epilogus
was sometimes spoken by the ‘ Grex’
or ‘ Caterva' of players ς as in the Asinaria,
Bacchides, Casina, Epidicus, and Captivi

of Plautus. In the Cistellaria, ,where
the Epilogue resembles that of the text,
the ‘ Caterva’ speaks of the actors as
absent. Probably however the ‘ Caterva’ was
there represented by one or more actore..

In some copies of Terence we find a sup- ’

plement of seventeen verses, which brings
Charinus' affair to a conclusion, but there
is no evidence of their genuineness, beyond
a notice by Donatus3 and their style is
sufficient to condemn them. The words
‘ Calliopius recensui ’ found in some copies
are also without authority3 though it was
the custom of critics to revise MSS„ and to
append their names as a certificate.
