And. iii. 2. 3:

“ Nunc primum fac istaec lavet: post deinde
Quod jussi ei dari bibere et quantum imperavi
Date,’'

with which Meineke following Grauert and Dobree, compares the solf
lowing, which he considers to have been part of Lesbia's prescrip-
hon: καὶ τεττάρων ᾠῶν μετὰ τοῦτο, φιλτάτη, Ι

τὸ νεοττίον, (Fragm. 'Av8. ii.)

And. ii. 4. 3:
“ Venit meditatus alicunde ex solo loco:
Orationem sperat invenisse se
Qui differat te.”

'rho fragment of Menander, of which this line is evidently a

Aa quoted by Donatus it stands thus:

and is clearly corrupt. The passage is also alluded to by Servius on
Virg. Aeneid. xii. 120, where he says that the sacred herb mentioned
by Menander was the myrtle, for which Terence used the generic torm
