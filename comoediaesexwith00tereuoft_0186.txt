11. Rex* te erqo in oeulis . . . Gestare]
¹ The king theu would always keep you in
his sight! ‘ In oculis habere,' like ‘in sinu
gestare,⁷ (compare Adelphi iv. 5. 75 : ‘⁸ Hic
uon amandus? hicine non gestandus in
sinu est?’') means ‘to be very fond of a
thing) We may compare the common use
of the words ‘ ocule mi’ as a term of en-
dearment. The phrase ‘ in oculis gestare '
occurs only in this place, and it is most
probable that the verb ⁴ gestare ' was pur-
posely introduced by Terence from the com-
mon phrase ¹ in sinu gestare,’ to exaggerate
the expression as much as possible. It is

also possible that an allusion may be meant ·

to the ὀφθαλμοὶ βασιλέως. If Thraso was
one. of these he was a worthy successor of

μ the Pseutartabas of the ‘ Achamiansl

14. Odium] We find ‘ odium ’ used where
‘ taedium’ would be more common, in v. 5. 2:
“ Neque agri neque urbis odium me unquam
percipit ;’' and Hecyra ii. 1. 22: “ Jam-
pridem equidem audivi cepisse odium tui
Philumenam.'' For a similar sense of the
word see note on Hecyra i. 2. 48.

18. Reyem eleqantem narras] ‘ By your
account the king must be a man of taste!
For this sense of ⁴ elegans ' see below, scene
5. 18: “ Quum ipsum me noris quam ele-
gans formarum spectator siem ;” and so at
the end of the play Gnatho says of Thraso
that he is a man of Attio ‘ elegantia' (v. 8.
64). See also Heaut. v. 5. 19.

19. Perpaucorum hominum] ‘Aye‚ just
what he is,' replies Thraso; ‘he keeps
very select company! The same phrase
occurs in a well-known passage of Horace,
Sat. i. 9. 43—5-45 z

 

Maecenas quomodo tecum?

Hinc repetit. Paucorum hominum et
mentis bene sanae;

Nemo dexterius fortuna est usus-’⁷

Gnatho replies ‘ Ι should rather say he kept
no company at all if he lived with yon!v
Bentley reads ‘⁶ Perpaucorum hominumst,’
to avoid the hiatus. But this commonly
occurs at the end of a speech. See Ritschl’s
discussion of this subject in his Prolegomena
to Plautus, and the Introduction to this

Edition.

21. Mordere clanculum] ¹ They all
envied meg and carped at me on the aly?
From what follows we may suppose that
our good Thraso was a standing butt at
their entertainments, from which he always
came off, in his own estimafion, with flying
colours. The sort of jokes which Thraso
and his friends were capable of are well
described by Juvenal, Sat. ix. 9—11 :

certe modico contentus

 

Veiiv'iissisequitem, conviva joco mordente
Et &ffffisgkehemens intra pomoeria natis! ’
