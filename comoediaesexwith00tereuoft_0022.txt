in their presence} and that at the rehearsal he brought forward his ac·
cusations against Terence, which were, I may observe, entirely critical,
to the effect that the play was stolen from Naevius and Plautus.
Turning to the Prologue to the ‘Andria,’ we find that the objections
which Terence notices are of the same kind. He explains that he had
taken his materials from two plays of Menander, the ‘Andria' and the
⁴ Perinthia‚’ and then says, alluding to his opponents:

“ Id isti vituperant factum ; atque in eo disputant,
Contaminari non decere fabulas.’' (vv. 15, 16.)

Taking the story of Caecilius as a fact,-and it is not a likely one to have
been invented; for most of the stories about Terence are rather to his
disparagement,—we may conclude from it that the ‘ Andria’ must have
been well known for some time before its production on the stage. At
this reading of the play before Caecilius there may have been present
some, and Lavinius himself, perhaps, among the number, who looked
with no friendly eye on this young poet, promising as he did to gain a
large share of the applause which they were anxious to monopolize.
The author of the ‘Thesaurus ’ and the ‘ Phasma,’ who endeavoured to
take the public by storm by the violent incidents of his plays, his
‘charmed fawn’ and ‘running slaves and their mad masters' (see thev
Prologues to the ‘Heautontimorumenos' and ‘Phormio ’)‚ would be
particularly likely to be jealous of a rising poet who sought to interest
by elegance of language and simple liveliness of plot. Caecilius was
delighted: his approbation would be a passport to popular suecess3 the
days of clap-trap were numbered3 and some fault of a literary kind
must be found with a poet who was likely to prove such a dangero'us
rival. The ‘ Andria ’ might thus have become famous in literary circles'
before this Prologue was written, and enough might have been said
against its author fully to account for the language which he uses.

The general question of the opposition to Terence is an important
one. It is alluded to in all the Prologues, with the exception of those
to the ‘ Hecyra‚’ which are occupied with an explanation of the causes
which led to the previous failures of that play. *These prologues there-

fore are entirely scenic; but it is most probable that, if it had not been f
for the untoward circumstances which had attended the previous repre· ,-
sentations of that play, we should have had some more notices of the {
poet’s literary position. It will be uses ul, therefore, to say a few words
