506 TERENCE AN D THE NEW OOMEDY.

of their Latin pupils. A vast mass of Greek literature was at thecom-
mand of the play-wright. It was generally admired; and a play well
written, or, rather, well translated from one of the Greek plays, was sure
of success. But the point on which I wish here to insist was the extent
of that literature, and the familiarity with it which was possessed by all
the best Roman writers. We must therefore remember, in adjusting
the obligations of Terence to any one play of Menander, that while he
had before him as the special object of his imitation some particular
play—say, for instance, the ‘ Andria' or the ‘ Eunuchus‚’—-he was also
well acquainted with the whole of the Menandriau repertory, and
undoubtedly, whether unconsciously or intentionally, availed himself
always of his knowledge. So, to take an instance from our own litera-
ture, Shakespeare, in the composition of many of his pieces, had before
him more than one author whom he partially followed; and if in his
case we allow the existence of a presiding genius informing the whole,
and working up the old materials into a new and consistent creation, we
may, without any violence to historical truth, assume the same in the
case of Terence. Our want of information should lead us to be wide
rather thau narrow in our conclusions3 and we may fairly suppose
that even had we before us the plays of Menander from which Te·
rence is said more expressly to have copied in his existing comedies, we
should yet find in him much that is not in any single Greek play, -
and which, if not original, is to be gathered from many other plays
of the same, or perhaps of other authors. (See on the ‘Adelphi,’
p. 497.) The number of fragments of unascertained plays of Me-
nander which fit more or less closely with Terence, many of them
quite as well as those passages which are directly quoted' from the
‘corresponding plays of Menander, leads us to the conclusion that
Terence drew, not only from the single play which he had before him,
but also from his general knowledge of the works of Menander, and of
the other authors of Greek Comedy with which he was familiar.

These considerations are important if we would estimate rightly the
, genius of Terence. In language he was doubtless original. His diction
bears with it the mark of a rcfinement and a polished idiom which is not
found in other Roman writers of that period, and which is far superior
to the style of Plautus. The characters and situations of his drama
were no doubt the usual characters and situations of the N ew Comedy.
Of these enough has been said in the Introduction. But his manner of
treatment must have been his own. And if this is true of his language,
we must demand a. more accurate acquaintance with the plots of the
plays of Menander before we refuse to allow Terence originality m the
general subject of his comedies. The discrepancies which have been
already noticed must be taken, as far as they go, for a proof of this
