The
word ⁴ pessum ' is most probably a sub·
stantive. Compare ‘venum,’ ⁴ nuptum,'
wiotum) ‘paetum dare! It may be de-
ιρἰῖῧᾱός from βυσσὸς, an Ionic form of

6. Verba dare] Commonly in comio
writers for ‘decipere' See Eun. iv. 5. 1.
Donatus ad Eun. Prol. 24. Heaut. iv. 4.
13: “Verum aliquo pacto verba me his
daturam esse et venturam.”

8. Auni lubitum suerit eausam ceperit]
‘Oris he pleases 118 will at once seize on
some excuse! The various senses of the
futurum exactum are very difficult to
distingnishg and every grammarian gives a
different account of them. Some distinguish
four or five uses of it (see Lindemann on
Plautus, Captivi ii. 2. 64). It isclear thatin
the comic writers it is often used where we
should expect the simple future. So too
in Heaut. iii. 3. 23 : “ Hic prius se indicarit

u quam ego argentum confecero,” where.

however, there is a latent notion of rapidity
of actium In this manner Cicero often
uses ‘ videro,' dcc. In the present case the
occurrence of the tense in both clauses

γ repca of the action. The general under-

lymg sense is that of action already com-

1118ωά 111 future time. More than this can-
not be stated with certainty.

-qua ' in the sense of ⁴ both—and ' is com-
mon, as in Plautus, Trinummus iv. 4. 38:
“ Mores rapere properant qua sacrum qua
publicum;” Livy x. 38: “Consul insignis
qua paterna gloria qua sua.’' But the com-
ment of Donatus shows that the text stood
as above in his time3 and as the more un-
common phrase it is to be preferred. ⁵ Me '
is added in many editions after ‘praecipi-
tem.' It spoils the mette undoubtedly,
and is not found in many good authori·
ties.

14. Dee-renerum tollere] ‘They have de-
termined to acknowledge her child! It
was for the father of a child to determine
whether it should be brought up ς which he
did by the symbolical action of raising it
from the ground. Compare Horace, Sat.
ii. 5. 45: “Si cui praeterea validus male
filius in re Praeclara sublatus aletur ” (see
Macleane's note). See also Heaut. iv. 1.
13. Plaut. Amph. i. 3. 3: “Quod erit
natum tollito.” addressed to Alcmena, but
with reference to the father’s absence at the
birth of the child.

1⁶. Inter ee] Prepositions followed by
enclitica have generally in Terence and Plau-
tus the accent on the final syllable. Com-
pare ‘inter eas,' Hecyra i. 2. 103. 105;
inter se,' lb. i. 2. 1173 ‘apddwosl Ib. ii.
2. 12. 27. So too ‘praeter me‚' ⁴ propter
me,' ‘ erga te‚' frequently in Plautus. See
Eun. v. 5. 29. Hecyra v. 3. 35. Phormio
v. 8. 34. We meet with an exception in
the case of ‘ propter me.' in Act i. sc. 5. 36.
which is probably accounted for by the
emphatic sense of the pronoun in that paa-

sege.
