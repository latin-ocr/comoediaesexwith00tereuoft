Ι] this play we have two brothers, Demipho and Chremes. Chremes
had married a lady of property, named Nausistrata, whose estates lay in
the island of Lemnos, and by whom he had a son called Phaedria. Once
a year Chremes used to go to Lemnos to collect his rents, and used to
stay there on each occasion rather longer than was necessary, while the
rents which he brought home to his wife were less than in former
times when the prices of farm produce was not so high as at this time
(compare r. 8. 23, 24, and v. 8. 4-8)‚ which appeared unaccountable to
his wife, who did not however suspect him of any thing beyond careless-
ness and indolence in the management of her business. But it had
happened that about fifteen years before the events of this play he had
fallen in love with a Lemnian woman, by whom he had a daughter
called Phanium. So sor fifteen years he had two wives and two esta-
blishments, with perfect secrecy, for at Lemnos he went by the name of
Stilph03 while he put off his wise’s complaints about the short rents by
excuses of bad times, ill health, and so on. His brother Demipho had
a son named Antipho, and they had agreed that Chremes should now
go to Lemnos, and bring over his wife and daughter, and that the
cousins should be married at once, Phanium passing for the daughter of
a friend. With this object Chremes now makes his yearly visit to
Lemnos} and Demipho at the same time goes to Cilicia, where he·
expects to find a large sortun03 while their two sons, Antipho and
Phaedria, are lest under the charge of Geta, an old family servant of
Demipho's, who acted as their paedagogae. At first Geta endeavoured
to discharge his duty to his master·faithfully; but finding that this
conduct got him nothing but abuse, he altered his line, and gave his
two pupils every indulgence they demanded. This soon produced the
results which might have been anticipated. Phaedria fell madly in love
with a musio girl, whom he diligently escorted every day to and from
the school where she used to go sor her finishing lessons; but his case
was duperate, sor he had not a farthing, and she could not be got
from Dorio, the ‘lenm' without hard caah. Nor was it long berone
