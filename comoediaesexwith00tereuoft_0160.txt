quantity. Again, in iii. 11. 65 there is the
same variation of reading: though Weber (in
the Corpus Poetarum) gives “ Haec di condi-
derant.'' Donatus quotes from Virgil, Eclog.
iv. 61: “Matri longa decem tulerunt fas-
tidia menses.” Every play was rehearsed
before the Aediles before it was allowed to
appear in public. Those that> they ap-
proved they purchased from the poet, and
disposed of them again to managers. See the
notes on Didascalia of the Andria, and on
the second Prologus to the Hecyra. On this
occasion Lavinius evidently obtained a per-
usal of the play before its rehearsa13 and
when it came to be rehearsed then he broke
out with accusations of plagiarism.

24. Et nihil dedisse verborum tamen]
‘The thief,' he says, ‘has stolen and re-
presented a play, and yet he has not de-
ceived us at all.' All the commentators
quote Bentley, who imagines that there is a
hidden pun in the words ‘ fabulam dedisse,'
as if they meant ⁴ has played us a trick‚'
as well as ⁴ has brought out a play! ‘ F a·
bula' is certainly used in the sense of a
fiction, and ¹ fabulae ’ is a common expres-
sion of incredulity ; but we have not an in-
stance of ‘fabulam dare ' iu this sense.
For ⁴ dare verba ’ see note on Andria i. 3. 6.

25. Colacem] Bentley ejects the name of
Naevius from this line, reading ⁴ nempe!
He urges that the ‘Colax ' of Naevius is never
mentioned: and moreover that if he wrote
such a play, then Plautus must have pil-
fered from him, which would amount to an
excuse for Terence. But without such re-
finement, it is not impossible that both
poets may have treated the subject of the
⁴ Colax ;' and that this was the very fault of
which Lavinius accused Terence, that he

bon-owed from two Latin writers, as he had
already been accused of mixing up two
Greek plays. See note on Andria, Prolog. 5.

27. Imprudentia] Compare below i. 2.

56: ⁴⁸ Imprudens harum rerum ignarusque*

omnium ;” and Hecyra v. 4. 40: ‘⁴ Plus
hodie boui feci imprudens quam sciens ante
hunc diem unquam.’' Terence answers, ‘ If

the fault has been committed, it has been,

done unwittingly! In v. 33 he disclairns
all acquaintance with the Latin playssal-
luded to, while he ackuowledges that he
drew his characters of the Braggadocio and
the Parasite from the ‘Colax ' of Me-
nander. We need not trouble ourselves
to account for his ignorance of these parti-
cular plays of Naevius and Plautus. No
doubt then as now many a play had ‘a
short-lived reputation.

33. Ex Graeca] No apology was re·
quired, and none is made, for the tran&
lation of Greek originals. The Roman

drama made no attempt at originality„

and Terence kept closer perhaps than any
other to his models. Cicero has left us
a curious instance of his taste in De Fini-
bus i. 2, where he is defending his own
practice of writing on philosophy in Latin.
The whole passage is worth transcribiugz
“ Hoc primum est in quo admirer curin
gravissimis rebus (the treatment of philo-
sophical subjects) non delectat eos patrius

sermo, quum iidem fabellas Latinas ad ver·-v

bum e Graecis expressas non inviti legant
. . . Synephebos ego, inquit (the objector),
potius Caecili aut Andriam Terenti quam
utramque Menandri legam ? A quibus tan-
tum dissentio, ut quum Sophocles> vel op-
time scripserit Electram, tamen male con-
versam Atili mihi legendam putem.”
