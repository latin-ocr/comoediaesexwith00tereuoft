PHORMIO.

Da. Venere in mentem mihi istaec3 “ Namque inscitia est,

Adversum stimulum calces ?”
Facere, obsequi quae vellent.
Ge. Noster mali nihil quicquam primo.

Ge. Coepi iis omnia
Da. Scisti uti foro.

Hic Phaedria 2 30

Continuo quandam nactus est puellulam
Oitharistriam: hane amare eoepit perdite.

Ea serviebat lenoni impurissimo ;

Neque quod daretur quicquam: id curarant patres.

Restabat aliud nihil nisi oculos pascere,

35

Sectam, in ludum ducere, et reducere.

pulae ⁹ is generally used in Plautus for ‘ the
back,’ and not unfrequently in some such
way as this. See Asinaria ii. 2. 49, 50:

“ Ergo mirabar quod dudum scapulae ges-
tibant mihi,
Hariolari quae occoeperunt sibi esse in
mundo malum.”

Truculentus iv. 3. 19 :

“Jam laevorem tute scapulis istoc con-
cinnas tuis.”

27. Venere in mentem istaec] ‘ That old
proverb has come into my mind: “ It is
mere folly to kick against the goad.'’ ’ We
must supply ⁴ jactare! In all copies up to
Bentley's time these words were attributed
to Davus. Bentley gave them to Geta on
the ground that Davus could have known
nothing of the circumstances unless Geta
had told him. But this is hypercritical.
Davus throws in this maxim as a moral
application of Geta's story. He is a bit of a
moralist, as we have seen at the commence-
ment of this scene, vv. 5, 6, and in the first
scene of this act he comes out strong in that
line. Itis the part of a good listener to elench
a story with an appropriate remark now and
then3 and this did not escape Terence here,
nor in the opening scene of the Andria,
where he makes Sosia do this more than
once. See Andria i. 1. 33. 40. 114. Bent-
ley however was right in reading ‘Nam-
que,' on the authority of the majority of
manuscripts. ‘Namque' is used like ὅτι,
in introducing quotations. See Andria i. l.
40, 41 1

“ Sapienter vitam instituit: namque hoc
tempore ’
Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.’'

The proverb quoted here, well known from
its New Testament use, occurs very fre-
quently in classical authors. It is found
twice in Aeschylus:

οὔκουν ἔμοιγε χρώμενος διδασκάλῳ
πρὸς κέντρα κῶλον ἐκτενεῖς.

(Prom. Vinct. 323, 4.)

πρὸς κέντρα μὴ λάκτιζε, μὴ πταίσας
uofflc. (Agam. 1624.)
Pindar has it,

Ποτὶ κέντρον δέ τοι
Λακτίζεμεν τελέθει
Ὀλισθηρὸς οἶμος.
(Pythia ii. 173—5.)
and Euripides,

θύοιμ’ ἂν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον ἦ θυμούμενος
πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζοιμι, θνητὸς ὢν θεῷ.
(Baochoe 79⁴, 795.)

We do not find this Latin form of the proverb
elsewhere. The variety ⁴ calcitrare contra
stimulum ' is quoted by Forcellini from
Ammianus. In Plautus, Truculentus iv.
2. 59, we have a similar proverb: ‘¹ Si sti-
mulos pugnis caedis, manibus plus dolet.'’

29. Scisti utisoro] ⁴ You know how to
suit your mai-ket! Yon can take things
as you find them. Donatus explains the
proverb as derived from the conduct of
merchants, who do not set a fixed price
on their goods before they bring them to
market, but adapt their demand to the
market price.

33. Impurissimo] Here the word is used
in its full sense. In Eunuchus ii. 2. 4 it
has a modified meaning. In the next line
after ‘ quicquam’ we must supply ‘ Phae-
driae erat! The whole of this narrative
is told with admirable brevity.

36, In ludum] This girl was sent to
school to learn accomplishments, .for the
purpose of increasing her value. Donatus
remarks, “ Bene cavillatus est et joculariter
in adolescentem, cui aetas ad sectandos phi-
losophos apta erat.” Phaedria ought at
his time of life to have been going to pro-
fessors’ lectur-es himself, instead of dancing
