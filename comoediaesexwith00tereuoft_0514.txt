“Egon quicquam cum istis factis tibi re-

The construction of the infinitive in the fol-
lowing line has been frequently noticed.
See Index to the Notes.

3. Tuam rem . . . . animadvereuros 7]
‘ Did you think that others would attend to
your affairs more than yourself ?' ‘Anim-
adverto ’ is used here 111 a sense which
does not occur elsewhere. Cicero uses it
with an accusative in the sense of ‘ observe,’
‘ attend to,’ as in De Officiis i. 12: “ Equi-
dem illud etiam animadverto . . . lenitate
verbi tristitiam mitigatam ;’' a difficult pas-
sage in construction on other grounds.

4. Conmleres] See note on the im-
perfect conjunctive Andria iv. 4. 54. 111
the following line Donatus mentions an-
other reading, ‘ potiretur,’ which would give
a good sense. But the metre is against it,
for the third metre of the line would then
rim thus:

dele-epm pulmentum

⁴ poteretur‚’ as 111 v. 5. 2, where see note.
6. Spes opesque eunt . . . sitae] ⁴ Spes'
and ‘ opes' are commonly connected. Lin-
denbrog quotes Plautus. Captivi iii. 3. 2:
“ Spes, opesque, atque auxilia a me segre-
gant spernuntque se.'' Sallust ends his
history of Jugurtha by saying of Marius,

“ Ea tempestate spes atque opes dvitatis in
illo sitae‚'' cap. 114.

7. Equidem, here, nos . . . inmun-ue]
Bentley would read ‘Et quidem,' consider-
ing ⁴ Equidem’ with any but the first person
singular an archaism unknown to Terence,
and notices that many manuscripts have
‘Et quidem! But the best authorities
agree in the reading of the text, and we
have seen on Eunuchus v. 4. 34 that it
was used not only by Terence, but also
more than one hundred and fisty years aster
his time by Propertius, and a generationi
later again by Persius.

10. Numquid patri subolet ἲ] ‘Has
my father any suspicion ?’ The phrase is
common 111 Plautus, and occurs more than
once in Terence. In Heaut. v. 1. 26, we
had the word in the form of the third eon-
jugation. See note. A similar expression
occurs in Adelphi 111. 3. 42, 43:

Sinerem illum? an non sex
totis mensibus

Prius {lssdssem quam ille quicquam coe-
pen .

 

12. Strenuum hominem praebuit] ‘More-
over in this matter, just as in others, Phor-
mio has shown himself an active man-³
We generally find ‘ praebere ' in this sense
followed by the accusative case of the per- ’
sonal 111-01101111. Forcellini gives no other
instance of the present 1180. We have the
