derives ita name from one of these caskets of
‘mpnndiaz' see particularly Act iv. scene
1. In the Rudens the plot turns upon the
discovery of a similar casket, and in Act iv.
4. lto—180 we have a full description of
the ‘crepundia' in that case, which were
much what we now eall ⁴ charms,' elegant
toys inscribed with the names of the parents
of the child to make recognition more oer-
iain. The Greek word σπάργανα, which
originally meant ⁴ swsddling clothes,’ was
used in the ngoedians in the same sense.
eo OEdipns is made to speak of hia piereed
seat as his σπάργανα.
ΔΓ. λύὲ ιζ’ ἔχοντα διατόρους ποδοῖν
s· ας.
01. demde γ’ ὄνειδος σπαργάνων ἀνειλό-
μην.
OEdipns Tyrannus 1033, 103⁴.

As σπάργανα passed into the sense of
Auspnndia) so conversely ‘crepundia' is
-td by Pliny, xi. ⁶1, in the original sense
ol σπάργανα = “ Semestris loeutus est Croesi
' filins ln crepundiiu' ‘while yet in long
dot-hes! The word ⁴ mpnndia' was also
med {or childrsn's playthings qhifh were

. lo. Vides la utum] ⁴ Do you see'rhraso

there, Thais, what a band he is bringing
against yon ?’ Chremes begins to be in a
state of trepidation when he sees Thraso

fusion by her stupid questions about the
casket of ⁴ crepundia. le timidity of
Chremes is capitally drawn.

21. Peregrinus eet] Among other topica
of encouragement Thais reminds Chremes
that Thraso is a foreigner, aud will there·
fore be at a ‹ii-advantage if they go to law.
See note on Andria iv. 62 15.

22. Minus potens] ¹Lesa influential!
See ii. 3. 61, and Adelphi iii. 4. 57 : ‘⁴ Po-
tentes, dites, fortunati, nobiles.”

2³. Quod cavere ponis nultum admittere
eet] ⁶ lt is soolish to do what you can
avoid. 1 had rather have prevention than
cure! The idea is so common that it hardly
needs any illustration, The following is
quowd from Menander:

εὐήθειά μοι φαίνεται δηλουμένη
τὸᾶνᾶεῒῖν μὲν ὅσα δεῖ, μὴ φυλάττεσθαι δ’

25.] Chremes is anxious to be on the
σοῖο side, or at all events to get safely out
of the way, so he proposes ω rnn ovet-to
the sorum and get some friend· to witness
Thraso’s assault. For ⁴ advocati ’ see note
on ii. 3. ⁴8.
