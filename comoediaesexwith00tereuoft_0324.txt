ADELPHI.

Eum adjutare, assidueque una scriber03

Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant
Eam laudem hie ducit maximam, quum illis planet
Qui vobis universis et populo placent3

Quorum opera in ber, in otio, in negotio,

Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.
Dehinc ne exspectetis argumentum fabulae:
Senes qui primi venient ii partem aperient ;

In agendo partem ostendent.
Poetae ad scribendum augeat industriam.

, not have recourse to a great politician in

business, or to a wise man in private affairs,
and vioe versa?

21. Sine superbia] ⁴ Without any false
pride! ¹ You are every one of you on con-
venient occasions ready to avail yourselves
of their help3 and why should not Ι. ²’
Ruhnken refers ⁴ sine superbia ’ to Scipio,
Laelius, and Publius3 but this is not the
point in question. Our common expres-
sion, ‘ Yon are not too proud to accept their
help, ' exactly gives the meaning of the text.

23. Senes qui primi venient.. osten-
dent] Donatus strangely says “Σχῆμα
ἀποσιώπησις. Hic enim jam non senes
accipiendi essent. imo potius caeterae per-
sonae: sed ipsi senes in statario charactere
partem aperient: in amorio, partem osten-
dent.’' It seems simpler to understand it
of the distinction between the narrative
and action of the first act, which is an
introduction to the whole play.

Facite, aequanimitas

24. Facite, aequanimitas . . . auqeat ia-

austriam] Donatus on this passage says
‘deest vestra! which Bitschl accordingly
supplies to avoid the lengthened syllable
‘augeam’ But we meet with many such
cases in Plautus and Terence (see Iun-o-
duction on the meti-es of Terence), and we
must be content to take this as one. Do-
natus’ words merely mean that‘ vestra' is
to be supplied in sense. Bentley in

lates a whole line comp ounded of Hecyra,
Prol. 24, and Phormio, pProl. 35. He reads

“ — Facite aequanimitas
Bonitasque vestra adjutrix nostrae indus·
ΡΟΞΞ af} 'scribendum augeant indus·
ὅ

a combination which it is hardly necessary
to say does not look very Terentina.
