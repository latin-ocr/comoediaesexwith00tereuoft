PROLOGUS.

In his poeta hic nomen profitetur suum.

Terence in this prologue, as in all the
others, 'applies himself to some points par-
ticularly connected with his plays. Here he
begins by attacking his chief detractor, Lavi-
nius, and shows that in his plays he violated
the consistencies of common affairs ; and
warns him that he has other matters in store
if he is further provoked. He then proceeds
to 8 vindication of himself from the particular
charge now brought against him3 namely,
that he had stolen the characters of ⁴ Gnatho
and Thraso from the ⁴ Colax' of Naevius and
Plautus. If the characters are the same, he
says 18 reply, it has happened by accident.

was he aware of any Latin copies of it.
He concludes by maintaining his right to
make free use of the stock characters of the
Ι drama, on the ground that there is nothing
new under the sun. And- so he leaves his
best comedy in the hands of his audience.

1. Placere se studeat] Bentley would
read ¹ studeant,' comparing Andria iv. l. 2:

“ Tanta vecordia innata cuiquam ut siet
Ut malis gaudeant atque ex incommodis
Alterius sua ut comparent commoda ?''

But although this transition from the sin-
gular to the plural is not uncommon, we
have no MS. authority for the change.

censors and of enlisting in the army.

4. Si quis est] He here alludes to Lus-
cius Lavinius, who has been mentioned
before in the Prologue to the Andria v. 7.
He is there called ‘vetus poeta! He was
eonsiderably older than Terence, and ap-
pears to have been a poet of average repu-
tation, though Terence charges him with
dramatic faults. He seems to have made

‘Terence the object of an unceasing perse-

cution, and is alluded to frequently by
him. See the Introduction.
