Ph. Ah,

‘Jacula Prudentium ε’ “He that makes his
bed ill, lies there.’' ‘Intero,’ like the
Greek ἐντέμνειν (see Aeschylus, Agam.
16), means ‘ to crumble ’ or ‘cut up
ingredients into a salad.y The Greek
ὑποτρίβειν corresponds more exactly to the
Latin. ‘ Intrita’ (ὑπότριμμα) was a mix-
ture prepared in this way, and is used 111
this sense frequently by Pliny and Colu-
mella. See Forcellini. Donatus remarks
on this passage 1 “ Παροιμία apta parasito 3
quae de cibo est. Hoc enim inter rusticos
de alliato moretario dici solet ;'' and Eu-
graphius adds: “Cum male intritum ci-
bum coactus est sumere qui intrivit.'’

5. Obsecro te] Geta continuestoentreat
Phormio to help them3 while he iu the
mean time is turning over the possibilities of
the case in his own mind. ‘ What it· he shall
question me' about my conduct in this
business? He answers himself at once,
¹ Ah l 1 have it.' ⁸ What if he shall reply ?'
⁴ This will do, I think ς’ and now ‘let me
have the old man: all my plans are now
arranged iu my mind.' The two sets of
speeclies are quite independent of each
other. ⁴ Eccere’ is variously explained.
Some derive it from ‘ ecce res,' or ‘eccere
rem ;’ others, among whom is Dr. Douald-
sou (Varronianus x. 2), from ‘aedem Ce-
reris! ¹ Quid si reddet' has been also
explained, ‘ What if he shall return the
girl 011 my hands ?' but it is simpler to
suppose that Phormio „is merely casting
over in his mind the arguments which De-
mipho is likely to use. .

9. Atque in me omnem iram derivem
senis f] ‘ Derivare’ is properly ‘to turn
water from one channel to another ;' and so
generally ‘to turn asido! Cicero uses the
phrase of the text rather frequently:

11

“Quid est quod 111 alios accuses? Quid
est quamobrem putes te tuam culpam 11011
1110ᾱο derivare in aliquem sed communicare
cum altero posse ?'' In C. Verrem ii.
2. 20. ‘⁴ Dicam non derivandi criminis
causa sed ut factum est‚’' ⁴ Not for the pur-
pose of shifting the blame on some 0110
else,' Pro Milone 10. Lucretius uses the
word exactly in the sense of our ⁴ divert ι’

“Nec vitulorum aliae species per pabula
1)ὲὲῖῖτο queunt animum curaque levare! ’
(ii. 364, 365.)

ll. Vereor, . . . in nervum erumpat de-
nique] ‘ You are a brave aud friendly follow,
Phormio. But still Ι mquently 08111101
help fearing that that hardihood of yours
will end one day in the pillory.’ ‘Nervus’
is used iu many passages of Plautus iu the

‚general sense of ‘ prison,’ as in Curculio v.

3. 40: “Tu autem in nervo jam jacebis
nisi mihi argeutum redditur.'' hom Cur-
culio v. 3. 11 it is clear that it was pro-
perly applied to ⁴ the thongs which bound
the prisoner :'
‘⁴ Quia ego ex te hodie faciam
pilum catapultarium
Atque ita te nervo torquebo itidem ut
catapultae solent.’'

 

There seems to be good reason for sup-
posing that the feet were generally the
part tied, aud so that the punishment was
nearly equivalent to our ⁶ swcks! ln Plau-
tus' Poenulus v. 4. 114 a close embrace i·
thus described =

‘⁸ Condamus alter alterum ergo iu nervum , Δ

brachialem.”
The word occurs again in iv. 4. 15: “ Iu
