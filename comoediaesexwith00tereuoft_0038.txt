xxxii INTRODUOTION.

talisi-mss ‘gloria-mss ‘nesc'iss 3' and accordingly we always have ‘ gratiis' ψ
and ⁴ ingratiis,’ rather than the conti-acted form. In Terence we meet
with one clear exception at least to this rule in the case of propitius.

See Adelph. i, 1. 6 :
“ Irata quam illa quae parentes pro'pitii ;'’
and Phormio iv. 3. 31 :

“ Satin illi Di sunt pro'pitii? Nam sat sci0.’'

 

I do not quote ‘gratiam,’ which occurs in some few places, as an
example, because in all those instances the text has been objected to.
There can be no doubt, however, that we have in these passages the
genuine reading, and that the contractiori must take place in such
passages as the following:

“ O'mnibus qratiam habeo, et seorsum tibi praeterea, Demea.’'
ᾖ (Adelph. v. 9. 14. See note.)

“ Referetque qratiam ei, unaque nos sibi opera amicos junget.’'
(Hec. v. 2. 32.)

Among more common words, sive, nisi, mihi, tibi, sibi, ibi, are often
pronounced as monosyllables‚ ‘and consequently sometimes they coalesco
in pronunciation with the initial vowel of a following word.

The following more remarkable cases of words contracted in pronun-
ciation may be referred to this place:

favilla. “ Atque illi favillae plena, fumi ac pollinis.”

(Adelph. v. 3. 60.)

Pythiae. “ Non faciam, Pythias. N 611 pol credo, Chaerea?
(Eun. v. 3. 62.)

praeceps (in the “ Adolescenti ipsi eriperem oculos: p6sthac prae-
oblique cases) cipite'm darem,” (Adelph. iv. 5. 5,)

where we may also notice the contraction of adolescenti and oeulos.

mayie. As “Nunquam aedepol quicquam jam diu quod mdyis vellem
evenire.’' (Eun. v. 6. 1.)

1 may here remark that in the case of Greek words this contraetion did not take place.
Thus we have in Eun. iii. 3. 13, ‘⁴ Rus Sunii ecquod haberem.” There were also many
Latin words that did not admit it, as solium, solium, lanius, spolium, qladius, studium.
In all such cases it is very difficult to lay down a general rule3 sor the early usage itself
varied.
