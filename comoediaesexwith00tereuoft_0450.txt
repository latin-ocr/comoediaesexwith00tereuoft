‘I trow that they will be on good terms
with each other only on condition that I
do not receive her back.' He means that
as long as they are separated there will be
no danger of their quarrelling. Laches,
being a matter-ot'-fact old gentleman, takes
the words very literally. ‘ You don't know
that,' he says. ⁴ But after all it does not
matter a jot to you what they do when
your mother is gone.' For ⁴ ea gratia ’ see
note on Andria ii. 6. 2. The explanation
of the construction of ‘ tua refert' and the
cognate phrases has given great trouble
to grammarians. Professor Key considers
‘ refert' to be equivalent to ‘ rem fert) and
⁴ mea,' ‘tua‚' &c. to ‘ meam,’ ¹ tuam.'

This is consistent with his explanation of-

other forms. See Key's Latin Grammar,
§ela Others consider these forms to be
neuter plural. Madvig (Latin Grammar,
ξ 295), agreeing with most scholars of the
present day, takes them to be ablative
singular feminine. I am not convinced by
Key’s reasoning that ⁶ nostra interest’ is a
corruption of ‘ nostram inter rem est,' any
more than that ‘ qua propter-,⁹ and ‘interea,’
are for ‘quam (rem) propter,' ‘inter eam
(rem).’ This theory of supplying ‘res' is
unsound; the usage of the Latin language
is rather to use ‘ res' superfluously than to
leave it to be supplied. Nor do we ever
find such an expression as ‘rem fert,’ ‘it
brings advantage! The objection to Mad-
vig's view is similar; we do not find the
phrase ‘re ferre,’ *το be of advantage!
⁴ Interest' is explained by Forcellini as ‘ in
re est,' though he seems to give this ex-
planation without any reference to the ety-
mology. This view is adopted by Kennedy
(Progressive Latin Grammar, 161, n.). We
must clearly take all the similar cases of 8
long final ‘ εἶ’ together. ¹Phormio v. 7. 47:

‘⁴ Etiam dotatis soleo. Quid id ΙΙ nostra ἓ]
Nihil,'’

proves the long ‘a' in the present ease3

though Phormio iv. 5. 11 :

‘⁵ Datum eslse dolltis. Quid Ι tua. mall'um,
id refert? Magllni, Delmipho‚'’

which he quotes, does not prove* it. See
the note on the latter passage. In such
words as ‘antea‚’ ‘postea,' ‘ interea‚’
Donaldson argues that the final ‘a' is the
remnant of the neuter plural ‘ aec' or
‘ae‚' which appears in ‘antehac,’ ‘post-
hac‚’ ‘istacl He applies the same cri-
ticism to the forms before us, considering
⁴mea,' &c.‚ as equivalent to ¹ meae,’ ‘re’
being ‘rei.’ This view is not entirely free
from objection, but it has this advantage,
that ‘fero' is ’thus used absolutely (see
Andria i. 2. 173 ii. 6. 12), though itis not
easy to account for the dative ⁴ rei!

14. Fabula sumus, Pamphile, senex
atque anus] ‘ In a word we have already

become a by-word, “old man and old
woman.'''

7,8:

‘⁴ Heu me, per Urbem—nam pudet tanti
ma l—

Fabula quanta fui 1”

Compare also Epist. i. 13. 9. Donatus snp-
poses that the words ‘senex atque anus'
are quoted as the beginning of a sable. But
it is sar more natural to take them as a
simple proverbial expression.

16. Per tempus] See note on Andria
iv. 4. 44.

Compare Horace, Epod. xi.

Ac'r IV. Scmm IV. Phidippus is now
in a very different temper. He has dis-
covered his daughter's secret, and lays all the
blame of her separation from her husband
upon his own wife, completely absolving
