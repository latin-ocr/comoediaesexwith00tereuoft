‘ you are to say that I cannot keep the ap-
pointment which 1 made to meet him, that
he may not wait for me there to no pur-
pose! For ‘ imo’ see note on Andria iii.
5. 12, and sor ‘ constitui ' note on Eunuchus
i. 2. 125.

26. Crispus, crassus, caesius] Donatus
tells us that Apollodorus wrote φαλακρὸς,
in accordance with the Greek proverb Μυ-
κώνιος φαλακρός. All the inhabitants of
Myconus were said to be subject to bald-
ness. Donatus quotes from Lucilius :
4⁴ Myconi calva omnis juventus;’' but he
supposes Terence to have purposely written
‘ crispus ’' for ‘calvus’ For ‘ caesius ’ see
note on Heaut. v. 5. 17.

Aer ΙΙΙ. Scmm V. Pamphilus has just
sent off Parmeno when his father comes up
with Phidippus. This places him in a dif-
ficulty. How is he to explain why he will
not receive his wife again? Laches makes
some inquiries of his son on business mat-
ters, connected with the death of his friend
Phania at Imbros, and then proceeds to the
case of Philumena, who, he pretends, had
been sent for home by her father3 but

would now return. Pamphilus informs him
that he knows a11; that Philumena will
bear witness that this se 'on was not
caused by him3 but that as she and his
mother cannot agree, his duty to the latter
leads him to prefer her to his wife. To
avoid further importunity, he retires, lenv-
ing Phidippus and Laches to settle the
matter between them; and the conse-
quence is that Phidippus gets into ahigh
passion at what he considers this unworthy
treatment of his daughter, and goes off in a
rage, while Laches prepares to vent his
annoyance on Sostrata.

The Metre is as follows3 vv. 1-34, tro-
chaic tetrameter catalecti03 35-65‚ iam-
bic trimeter.

1.] Laches says, ‘Did yon not say just
now that she was only waiting for my son?
Well, they say he has come home; let her
come back! Compare ii. 2. 26 :

 

“ Postquam attendi

Magi-s, et vi coepi cogere ut rediret, sancte

Ndiijpldssge apud vos Pamphilo se absente
perdurare.’'
