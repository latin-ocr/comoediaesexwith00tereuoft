xl INTRODUOTION.

Hecyra v. 3. 32 ⁶. One instance occurs in which modo is pronounced
as a dissyllable with its first syllable lengthened:
‘⁴ Mihine P Tibi ergo. Mo'do introii. Quasi ego quam dudfim
rogem.” (Andria v. 2. 9.)

The reader will observe that the position of quasi also in the same line

is peculiar. Both cases are probably due in this instance to'the metrical
accent, combined with the broken form of the sentences.

royo. “ Ro'qo : negat vidisse.'’ (Andria ii. 2. 21.)
“Heus Demea, roqat frater ne abeas longius.''
(Adelph. v. 5. 1.)
“ Ro'qa velitne uxdrem an non.”
(Hec. iv. 1. 43.)
“Ut rossqem, quod tempus conveniendi patris me capere jnbeat.’'
(Phorm. v. 4. 9.) ’

,6. Words compounded of prepositions, ἕω. ending in a vowel are
contracted. - The following cases occur:

deamo. “ Nae ego fortunatus homo sum. Deamo te, Syre.”

(Heaut. iv. 6. 21.)
“At hic dehortatus est me ne illam tibi darem.”

(Phorm. v. '7. 17.)

dein, deinde, very often in all writers. In one instance this word is
resolved by Terence:

dehortor.

“ Nunc primum fac istaec lavet3 post deinde?

(Andria iii. 2. 3,)
where ‘ deinde ' forms a bacchius (⁹“ ’).

debono ‚· always contracted.

deorswm. “ Ne sfirsum deorsmn cfirsites.” (Eun. ii. 2. 46.)

Compare Adelph. iv. 2. 34. 36.

seorewm. ‘⁴ O'mnibus gratiam habe03 et seorswm tibi praeterea Demea.”

(Adelph. v. 9. 14.)

ὅ Itis remarkable that no case of ‘ modus ' is contraeted in Terence. This leads me to
doubt Professor Key’s derivation of ‘immo ' or ⁴ imo' from ‘ in modo‚’ to say nothing of
any other objection to it. See note on Andria iii. 5. ll. In such a case the absence of a
contraetion in Terence (and, as far as I have examined the word, in Plautus) is to my
mind decisive. The case of ‘modo' shows indeed that it would have been possible to
abbreviato. the ablative ‘ modo ' similat-lym but as we do not find this to have beon the
mse, we must not coin a contraction for the sake of the etymology.
