“qui ita nos anxit ut indejus quoddam in

explanation of the word.)

distance in space, asin Hecyra iii. 1. 18:
“Nova res orta est porro ab hac quse me

abstrahat.”
ν 2⁴. Favete, adeste, δῖα] ‘Keep silence,
and weigh the matter fairly as umpires, that
you may decide on the fate of my future
play a! ‘Favete’ is a term commonly used
in sacrificial rites (see Macleane' s note on
Horace, Carm. iii. 1. 2, ‘favete linguis ⁹.)

It is simply an adjective, agreeing with the
substantive ⁴quid.’ ‘De integro,' ‘ab in-
tegro,' and ‘ex integro‚’ are used indiffe-

27. Eaeiqendae] Compare Hecyra, Alter
Ptol. v. 7: “Partim sum earum exactus,
partim vix steti.” ιΥοιι are to decide the

The metre of this prologue, and of the
first scene, is iambic trimeter. In all
Terence’ s plays the prolog-ue and the open-
ing scene are in the same metre.

Acr 1. Senum Ι. This scene introduces us
to the chief character of the play, the young
Pamphilus, and his connexion with the An-
drian stranger. Simo relatos the circum-
stances which led to his suspicions and his
discovery of their love. He then engages the
assistance of Sosis in the scheme by which
he proposes to ascertain the real feelings of
his son. The art of this scene has been justly

elegant and vivid‚ Cicero (De Oratore· ni. 80)
has quoted it with marked praise.
