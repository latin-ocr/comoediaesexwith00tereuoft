” ε” Keeping these considerations in mind, I now go on to give a brief
’. ’ sketch of the various metros used in Terence,

Taking the paroxytone dissyllable a· the basis of metrical measure, we
, may arrange the various‘measures as follows, using for simplieity the

’,- ordinary notation.

a. Trochaic. Ι :L u - υ
β. Iambie. υ , -’ υ -
γ. Cretie. -ν υ -
δ. Antispastic. υ Δ. Δ, υ
ε.” Bacchiae. u -ν .-

In addition to these we have once used in Terence a mixed measure
² called choriambic (-Ι u u -t).
Trochaie and iambie verses are to be measured by dz'lyodiae, or metrae,
> ' each consisting of a double foot: the primary rule (in verses where the
, quantity of syllables is distinctly marked, a· in Greek) being that in a
Ἴ 5 trochaie line the first, third, fifth, and seventh feet must be trochees3 in
χ an iambie line the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth must be iambie.
ζ Δ Cretic and bacchiae measures are often referred to the paeonio mea-
] · sures3 but it is clear that a cretio is a trochaic metro deficient by one
. 'syllable The bacchiac is merely an improvement -on the amphibraeh
’- (υ ,- υ), by increasing the weight of the final syllable.

I. Tnocnuc anns.

Ι. ΤΒοοΗΑῐο 'rerinl-,arms CATAan'rxo, called by the Romans Quad-

ratus or septenarius. This verse consiste of four trochaie metres, of
’ which the last is deficient by one syllable.

'l'he following lines are a good example of this kind of verse:
‘⁶ Di boni bolni quid porto Ι Sed ubi inveniam Ι Pamphilum,
Ut metum in quo Ι nfine est adimam athue expleam animum Ι
gaudio Ρ
Laetus est ne Ι scio quid. Nihil est: Ι nondum haee resci Ι vit mala.'’
(And. ii. 2, 1-3.)
‘⁸ Nunquam ita quisquam Ι bene subducta Ι mitione ad vit Ι tim fuit
Quin res, aetas, Ι fisus semper [aliquid apport Ι et novi;
Aliquid moneat, Ι fit illa quae te Ι scire credas Ι nescias3
Et quae tibi putlaris prima in Ι experiendo ut Ι repudies.’'
(Adelph. v. 4. 1—4.)
