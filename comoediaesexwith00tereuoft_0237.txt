INTRODUCTION.

Tan plot of the Heautontimorumenos turns, as is often the case,

, partly upon the recognition of a child which had been exposed as an
’ ‘² infant. Sostrata the wife of Chremes had an infant daughter, which her

· husband refused to bring up, and ordered to be exposed. She gave it to an

old woman for that purpose, attaching to its dress a ring, from a supersti-
39 tious feeling that the child ought not tobe entirely disinherited. The old
v woman, instead of exposing the child, brought her up as her own daughter,
and named her Antiphila. When she grew up she attracted the attention
’ᾗῇ of Clinia son of Menedemus. Their attachment continued for some time
before it came to the knowledge of Clinia’s father. As soon as he dis-
covered it he began to persecute his son about the affair, till at last the
g young man, to put an end to the dispute, went to Asia, and there entered
’7 the service of the king. N o sooner had he gone than his father repented
his οῦτοι-ιδῃ and finding that his son was past recall, he determined‚ as
⁷ the only amends he could make, to inflict upon himself a continual pe—

nance. He sold his house, and all his servants except afew to work upon

³. · a farm which he purchased. There he kept himself at work from morn-

ing to night. Three months passed ιιι this way, and at the end of that

time, Clinia, who could not support any longer his absence from his
ἶ mistress, returns and’ is received into the house of Chremes, whose son
:gl-J Clitipho bad been his friend from his childhood. No sooner has he
arrived than his servant Dromo is sent with Syrus, Clitipho’s slave, to
⁷ bring Antiphila to her lover. Syrus discharges his errand more cleverly
“ss than was intended; he found Antiphila alone, sor her reputed mother,
{q Philtere, had died in the interval, and iu circumstances which shewed
x that she was still faithful to Clinia. Thinking besides to do a stroke of
business for his own nmter,he brings attho same time Bacchis, Clitipho's
mistress, a very different character from Antiphila: and that Chremes
ι may baveno suspicion of this connection of his son's, it is arranged
