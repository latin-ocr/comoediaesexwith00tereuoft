her. He is immediately attacked by Simo,
and desired to explain his story of the quar-
rel between Pamphilus and Glycerium.
Davus evades his questions, and pro-
ceeds to tell the news which Chremes has
brought of her Athenian parentage. Simo
interrupts him, and orders him off to be
bound hand and foot, with plentiful threats
of punishment for his deceit. Simo pro-
ceeds to the house to call out his son3
Chremes meanwhile endeavouring to miti-
gate his anger.

, Metre3 vv. 1—15. 17, 18, trochaic tetra-
meters catalectic; 16, 19-24, iambic te-
trameters; 25-30‚ iambic trimeters.

4. Omnis res est jam in vado] ⁴ Every
thing is now safe.' Compare Adelphi ii.
μ 4. 3. The same phrase occurs in Plautus,
Aulul. iv. 10. 78 : “Haec propemodum jam
esse in vado salutis res videtur.'’ In Ru-
dens i. 2. 81 we have it in an account of a
literal escape from shipwreck: ‘⁴ Nunc nunc
periculum est ; ejecit alteram—At in vado
est: jam facile enabit.” The metaphoris
derived from swimming, in which case shal-
low waters are safest. On the contrary,
the shallows being dangerous to sailors, we
have au opposite metaphor from the same
language: ‘¹ Sed quoniam emersisse jam e
vadis et scopulos praetervecta videtur oratio
mea,” Cicero, Pro Caelio, c. 21. See note
on Eunuchus v. 8. 8.

that Davus means to hint at the discovery
of the father of Glycerium3 but this does
not come out till later. ⁴ Noster ¹ was the
common appellation of a master by his ser·
vants. See Plautus, Miles Glor. ii. 5. 20:
‘¹ Persei-utari hoc volo, Sceledre, nos nostri an
alieni simus,” ‘whether we belong to our
master or to some one else.’ The true ex-
planation of the term here is that Davus
professes to consider Chremes still as the
destined fat-her—in-law of Pamphilus and so
adopts him as his master. He pretends that
he has got every thing in readiness for his
young master's marriage with Philumena,
and desires that she may be sent for at
once (see above iii. 4. 2).

7. Id enimvero hinc nunc abest] ‘ That,
to be sure, is all that's wanting now! He
says this ironically.

8. Etiam tu Ιιοι· reepondes ?] ⁴ Are you
answering me this question ?' There is no
need for Bentley's alteration to ‘ responde!
We may compare Eun. v. 7. 16: “Quid
dixisti pessima ? Etiam rides ?'' Heaut.
ii. 2. 6 : “ Etiam caves ne videat forte hinc
te a patre aliquis exiens ?'' where the ques-
tion amounts to an exhortation, which is
implied in every case, as in the correlative
phrases ‘ Quin taces ?' διο.

12. Quid illum censes ?] ⁴ What do you
think he is doing? He is quarrelling with
her to be sure! For the phrase compare
Plautus, Trin. 111. 3. 83 : ‘⁴ Quid illunc putas
