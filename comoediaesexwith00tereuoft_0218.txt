CHAEREA.

THAIS.

PYTHIAS.

072.. Apud Antiphonem uterque, mater et pater,
Quasi dedita opera domi erant, ut nullo modo

Introire possem quin viderent me.

Interim

Dum ante ostium sto, notus mihi quidam obviam

Venit.

Ubi vidi, ego me in pedes qua-ntum queo 5

In angiportum quoddam desertum ; inde item
In aliud, inde in aliud ε ita miserrimus
Fui fugitando ne quis me cognosceret.

Sed estne haec Thais quam video P Ipsa est.

AcT V. Senive ΙΙ. Chaerea had been
unfortunate in his attempts to get rid of his
conspicuous dress. Antipho’s parents were
at home, so that he could not enter, and
he has run over the whole city to escape
from an acquaintance who met him. He
now sees Thais, and, putting a bold face on
the matter, goes up to her. He excuses
himself very coolly, to the great annoyance
of Pythias: but when Thais explains what
had been her intentions about Pamphila,
and how they were all thrown out by this
event, he engages to marry Pamphila, and
congratulates himself and Thais upon the
fortunate turn which matters seem likely to
take. Nor can she be too hard upon one
whose only fault has been that his passion
has been too powerful for him. Chremes
is now coming with Pamphila's nurse, to
ascertain her parentage for certain: and as
Chaerea wishes to escape observation they
go into the house to wait for his arrival, in
spite of the protestations of Pythias, who
does not know what next to expect from
him.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

2. dedica opera] ἐκ προνοίας, ‘on pur·
pose! Cicero uses the expression more than
once. See De Oratore iii. 50: “Horum
vicissitudines efficient ut neque ii satientur
qui audient fastidio similitudinis, nec nos id
quod faciemus opera dedita facere videa-

Haereo.

mur.’' Compare Plautus, Poenulus iii. l. 5:

‘¹ Atque equidem hercle dedita opera ami-
r cos fugitavi senes.''

The simpler phrase ‘ data opera ’ also occurs
in the same sense.

5. Eyo me in pedes quantum queo] Ἰ
take to my heels as fast as I can! We find
the full phrase ‘⁴ hinc me conjicerem proti-
nam in pedes‚” Phormio i. 4. 13, and in
Plautus, Captivi i. 2. 13: “ Sinon est qui
dem, mene vis dem ipse in pedes ?'’

6. In anyiportum quoddam desertum]
⁴ Into an empty street! The word ‘ angi-
portus' is said to signify either a narrow
street, as in this passage, or a ¹ cul de sac,'
a street without an outlet‚ as in Adelphi iv.
2. 39: “Id quidem angiportum non est
pervium ;'’ but there the word ‘angipor-
tum ' does not of itself bear that meaning.
Festus derives the word from “angustus
portus,’ and explains ⁴ portus’ to mean
‘privata domus,' so that ‘angiportus' is a
narrow street between private houses, or
leading to a private house, as opposed to
the wider thoroughfares of the public part
of the city. This is evidently the true ex-
planation, though we need but go to ‘an-
gustus! ‘ Ango ' originally means ‘ to draw
close,' ‘ to narrow,’ ‘ to press into a corner '

(see the passages quoted by Forcellini; ,

though in Horace, Sat. ii. 2. 64, the best
reading is certainly ⁴ aiunt’), and thence ⁴ to
suffocate! ⁴ Angustus' and other ,worda
of the same class are in fact derived from
the common root ‘ang.' Compare the
Germ. ⁴ eng.' ·· ’
