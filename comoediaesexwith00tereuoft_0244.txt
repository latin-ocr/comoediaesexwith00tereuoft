Μουσικὴ and Γυμναστική were with him
the sister sciences of educat-ion, the one of
the mind, the other of the body.

24. Amicum inyeniosretum, 8sc.] ‘ Re-
lying on the ability of his friends, not on
his own qualifications.' There is an allu-
sion here to the intimacy of Terence with
Scipio and Laelius, the latter of whom is
reputed to have assisted him in the com·
position of his plays, if not to have been
the author of them. Cicero mentions this
story in one of his letters to Atticus (vii. 3) x
‘¹ Secutusque sum, non dico Caecilium (ma-
lus enim auctor Latinitatis est), sed Teren-
tium, cujus fabellae propter elegantiam ser-
monis, putabantur a C. Laelio scribi.” See
note on Adelpffi, Prol. 1⁵, and Introduction,
and Macleane's note on Horace, Epist. ii. 1.

28. Date crescendi copiam . . . sine vitiis]
‘ Give those an opportunity of rising who give
you the opportunity of witnessing new plays
without faults.' The construction of the
words ‘novarum qui spectandi faciunt co-
piam ' is singular. We meet with similar
constructions in Plautus, Captivi iv. 2. 72:

‘⁴ Nominandi istorum tibi erit magis quam
edendi copia.”

Cicero, Philipp. v. 3: “Agitur utrum M.

Antonio facultas detur opprimendae reipub-

licae, caedis faciendae bonorum, diripiendae

urbis, agrorum suis latronibus condonandi,”

and Cicero, In Verrem ii. 2. 31 t “ Qui-

bus ne rejiciendi quidem amplius quam

trium judicum . . . leges . . . faciunt potesta·

tem.” We have two other instances of an

irregular use of the gerundive in Terence.

Hecyra iii. 3. 12:

“ Ego ejus videndi cupidus recta con-
sequor‚”

where ‘ejus ⁵ refers to his wife; and Phor-

mio i. 3. 24:

‘⁴ —— Ego in eum incidi infelix locum,
Ut neque mihi ejus sit amittendi nec re-

tinendi copia‚”

where ‘ ejus ’ has reference to his mis-

tress. See the notes on both passages.

critioe have given various explanations of
this construction. ΤΙιο true explanation

seems to be, that in all these cases the noun
and the gerund alike depend upon the pre-
ceding substantive or adjective, the geruud
being added epexegetically. Thus in the
text the word immediately depending upon
‘copiam ’ is ⁴ novarum fabularum,’ and
⁴ spectandi ’ is added to complete the notion-
Lindemann’s view (on Plautus, Capt- ir. 2.
72) that ‘istorum ' is the latter of two aub-
stantives depending on ⁴ nominandi‚’ which
again depends on ¹ copia,’ is faneiful rather
than true3 for though the gerund is in ori-
gin a noun, yet in construction itha-the
force of a verb. The true parallel to this
idiom is that of the Greek infinitiva used
epexegetically with the genitive after verbs
and nouns. Compare Sophocles, 'trachiniae
56, 57 z

See many other instances, from Thucydides,
Xenophon, and Plato, in J elf’s Greek Gram-
mar, 898. Ι. β.

30. Ne ille pro se dictum ean‘stz'met]
‘'Without faults, I say-; for do not let him
suppose that I have spoken for him, who in
a recent play made the people give way for
a slave running in the street.' This allu-
sion is of course meant for Luscius Lavinius
who seems to have violated decorum in this
matter3 and his excuse seems to have been
that the slave whom he introduced thus had
a mad master. But ‘⁴ why,'' says Terence,
“ need he be slave to amadman ?'' In other
words, why have recourse to so gratuitous
a story ? It is not very easy to see iu what
the fault of Lavinius consisted. &om

speaks,
