hindrance is conveyed by the preposition,
as in ‘obloquor,' ‘objicio,' ‘obrogo‚' and
‘ obscaevo‚’ Plautus, Asinaria ii. 1. 17,
which means ‘ to hinder by a bad omen!
11. Vide ne ille hue prorsus se irruat]
‘Mind he does not rush straight in here!
⁴ Prorsus ' is here used in its original sense
of ‘ straightway,' like ‘ recta via! See note
on Eunuchus v. 8. 52, for another applica-
tion of the word. ‘Irruo’. is here used
reflexively as ⁴ proruo ’ in Eunuchus iii. 5.
.5l (note); ‘erumpo' in Virgil, Georgic i.

“Aut ubi sub lucem densa inter nubila
Dizeezi erumpunt radii ;'’

and Caesar, Bell. Civil. ii. 14: “Portis se
foras erumpunt.’'

15. Non hercle hic quidem durare quis-
quam . . . potest] Syrus comes to the
centre of the stage in great haste, and pre-
tending not to see Demea. His object is
to account for Ctesipho’s being in the city,
and not at the farm as he had told his
father, and so he hits upon a plausible tale,
which the old man is more likely to credit
from his general opinion of his son, as well
as from the story that Syrus had previously

told him of Ctesipho’s indignation against
Aeschinus when he found him carrying off
the music girl. He now rushes in, as if he
were just smarting from a severe thr-ash-
ing, and had thoughts of quitting his place
in consequence. ⁸ No one ean ever stay
here,' he says, ‘ if things go on in this way.
Indeed 1 should like to know how many
masters I have? Oh, I am in such pain !’
‘ Duro ¹ has the double notion of ‘ bearing
with a thing ¹ and ‘ continuing in a state!
Compare Plautus, Truculentus ii. 3. 5, ⁶,
where both senses are found:

ι’.4. 1 Νξη quis parumper durare opperi-
D.n3uin hercle lassus jam sum durando.
miser.''

More examples may be found in Forcellini
of both senses. We must generally decide
by the context which meaning is to have
the prominence. In Hecyra ii. 2. 27 we
have ‘ perduro ¹ used reflexively in a similar
sense:
“ Sancte adjurat
Non posse apud vos Pamphilo se absente ⁷
perdurare.”

20. Vide, ut discidit labrum] ‘See how
he has cut my lip.’ Syrus here makes a
