8 AN DRIA.

Non qui argumentum narret, sed qui malevoli
Veteris poetae maledictis respondeat.

Nunc quam rem vitio dent quaeso animum advortite..
Menander fecit Andriam et Perinthiam.

Qui utramvis recte norit ambas noverit.

Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen
Dissimili oratione sunt factae ac stilo.

Quae convenere in Andriam ex Perinthia
Fatetur transtulisse atque usum pro suis.

,Id isti vituperant factum3 atque in eo disputant,

Contaminari non decere fabulas.
Faciunt nae intelligendo ut nihil intelligant.
Qui quum hunc accusant Naevium, Plautum, Ennium

rather than in explaining his plot! The ac-
cusative is found also in Plautus, Trinum. iii.
2. 56: “Me qui abusus sum tantam rem
patriam,'' Ἰ who have run through such
a large property ;' and in Bacch. ii. 3. l26:
⁴⁴ Quum se excucurrisse illuc frustra sciverit
Nosque aurum abusos.'’ The word ‘qui'
has been variously explained by commenta-
tors. Some suppose it to be equivalent to
⁴ quippe qui ² or ‘ut.' It is simply the ab-
lative signifying the ⁴ purpose,' as ‘ quo ’ in
the Prol. to Eunuchus, v. 28: “Non quo
furtum facere studuerit.’'

11. Non ita dissimili] ‘They are not so
very unlike in plot! For the phrase ‘ita
dissimili' compare Livy iv. 12: ⁴⁴ Haud ita
multum frumenti ;” and Cicero, In Verrem,
Act. ii. 4. 491 “ Sunt ea (simulacra) peram-
pla atque praeclara, sed non ita antiqua,''
‘not so very old.' The metre of this line
has perplexed commentators. Bentley sug-
gests ⁴ et tamen‚’ which occurs in iv. 1. 9,
and elsewhere, to avoid the pronunciation
of ‘argumento’ as a trisyllable. But we
have other instances of a long syllable elided
in pronunciation, as in ⁴ pulmentum ’ from
⁴ pulpamentum,' ‘quaestor ’ from ‘ quae-
sitor‚’ ⁴ mala ' from ‘ maxilla,’ besides very
many in the languages derived from Latin,
as the French ⁴ serment ' from ⁴ sacramen-
tum,' and the like. Bentley again argues
that ‘quidem’ would be required in the
first clause if we keep ⁴ sed tamen ;' but
this will not hold altogether. See Adelphi
iv. 4. 15: “ Sensi illico id illas suspicari:
sed me reprehendi tamen. ’' It is better
therefore to let the text stand.

16. Contaminari] Here used in its origi-
nal sense ⁴ to mingle together! ⁴ Con-
tamen,’ connected with root ⁴ tag-' (tango),
⁴ tagimen‚' ‘to bring into contact! We

have the word used again in Heaut. Prol.
17, in the same sense :

‘⁴ Nam quod rumores distulerunt malevoli
Multas contaminasse Graecas, dum facit
Paucas Latinas.''

In Terence the word is used in this sense
always. In Eun. iii. 5. 4, ⁴⁴ Ne hoc gau-
dium contaminet aegritudine aliqua‚’' there
is no necessary idea of defilement. Lu-
cretius uses it once, in iii. 886 =

 

neque enim se dividit illim

Nec removet satis, a projecto corpore, et

Seluufilrigit sensuque suo contaminat
astans‚’' ”

meaning ‘unites it to itself in sentient
feeling! The word does not occur in Plau-
tus at all. The sense of ‘defilement' is
later, and is not found in the Augustan
writers, except in Horace (Carm. i. 37. 9) :
‘⁴ contaminato cum grege turpium Morbo
virorum.'' We may compare the Greek
χρὶω, which meam, 1. to touch3 2. to de-
file.

17. Far-imit nae intelligendo] Bentley
reads ⁴ ne ⁷ for ‘nonne ς’ but the sense re-
quires ‘nae,' which is often written ‘ne ⁹
in MSS.

18. Naevium, Plautum, Ennium] ,This
is undoubtedly the true chronological order
of these poets. The whole point has been
admirably discussed by Ritschl, De AEtate
Plauti, and the question is well stated in
the Dictionary of Biography and Mytho-
logy (Plautus). The word ‘auctores’ is
here used in the sense of ⁴ models,' ⁴ pat-
tems! Compare Cicero, In Verrem ii. 5.
26: “Unum cedo auctorem tui facti: unius
profer exemplum.” So Horace, Sermd. 4.
122: “Habes auctorem quo facias hoc.'¹ In
