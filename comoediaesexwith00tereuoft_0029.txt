INTRODUOTION. xxiii

¹· in the Dictionary of Biography on the position of Terence in Comedy‚
who ,fairly shows that this “ vis comica” could hardly be expected in the
majority of Terence’s playa, which are more properly “ sentimental come-
dies,'’ and that he may be classed with those who have excelled in manner

- ’ rather than in matter, with Massinger, Racine, and Alfleri, rather than

 

with Aristophanes, Shakespeare, or Moliere. What Greek poets are alluded
‚ to by Caesar we cannot definitely say. As far as fragments of Menander
and his class have descended to us, I should be inclined to say that
Terence is not deficient in humour by their side, and the wit of Plautus
was certainly native, fresh from the baths and the forum. Caesar’s
reading may have embraced Aristophanes, who found no antitype
among the Romans. At all events we may well be content with the
elegance' and purity of our poet’s diction, and with the genuine wit
which appears in a dry subdued form in almost every page of his
works.

This question is well stated by an able writer in the ‘ Quarterly
Review,’ who has given a discriminating sketch of the merits of
Terence in the following words : “ What is to us repugna-nt in the plots
of Terence—the want of variety, the constant iteration of the same or
similar incidents3 the lost or stolen maiden in slavery, who turns out
to be the free-born daughter of an Athenian father3 the two fathers,
the harsh and the mild, the rustic or the citizen3 the two sons3 the
elever knavish slave, as necessary as the Spanish Gracioso—all this
Terence has in common with Menander. So, too, all that is repulsive
in manners and in morals, the looseness of converse between the sexes,
the cry to J uno Lucina upon the stage, is mere translation ². But with
all these common faults, and with the language so much less clear and
refined, the versification so much more rude and inharmonious than the
iambica of the Greek Comedy, what lover of classical literature, what
lover of genuine poetry, who, with the slightest taste for wit and ele·
gance, does not dwell with delight on the comedy of Terence? To the
initiate all this is so familiar as to bear no illustration3 the uninitiate
must be left to themselves, to their unenvied obtuseness as to some of the
most exquisite touches of true human feeling, to the fine play of comio

- fancy. The tradition of the popularity of Terence since the revival of

letters (and long before, as we have said, his plays were the stolen

² The writer has expressed himself too strongly here. This might lie true of Plautus,
but not of Terence. His plays are in general more pure than most of our own classieal
eomedies. See note on Eunuchus iii. 5. 36.
