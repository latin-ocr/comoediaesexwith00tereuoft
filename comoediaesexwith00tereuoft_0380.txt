wffle serves to illustrate these common

Acr V. Souna Ι. Syrus comes from his
master's house in a state of intoxication.
This is auew aggravatiou to Demea, who
ia disgusted at this fresh proof of the dis-
order of his brother's house. Syrus treats
him with contempt.

The Metre is iambic trimeter.

1. Aedepol] ‘On my word, my dear
Syrus, you have cared for yourself deli-
cately, and managed your business well!
‘ Aedepol ⁹ is here used, as in many cases, by
a man, though originally a woman’s oath.
⁶ Syrisce ' is a term of endem-ment, as are
all such diminutives in Plautus very fre-
quently. ‘Munus' is here used as ‘pro-
vincia' in Plautus, captivi iii. 1. 14: ‘⁸ Ipsi

De. exemplum omnibus

obsonant quae parasitorum aute erat provin·
cia,” and ‘ praefectura,’ Captivi iv. 3. 7:
“ Nunc ibo in meam praefecturam, ut jus
dicam larido,
Et quae pendent indemnatae pernae eis
auxilium ut feram.’'

4. Illud sie vide Exemplum disciplinae]
⁴ There is a fine specimen of ‘good disci-
pline sor you!’ Lachmann (note on Lu-
cretius iii. 347) would rea‘d ‘Illud sis vide
exemplum disciplinae eccum! But ‘ecce
autem ' is the regular form which Terence
uses, as in Eunuchus ii. 3. 63 v. 5. 25.
Adelphi i. 2. 733 iv. 7. 4. Hecyra iii. 5.
53; and we never find ‘autem' at the
commencement of a sentence. The hiatus
in this verse is justified by the termiuatiou
of the sentence at ‘ disciplinae!

9. Tuam rem constabili-raes] ‘ If 1 were
your servant,' says Syrus, ‘you would be
a rich man, and would have made your
fortune.’ ¹ Rem constabilire’ is particu-
larly used with reference to the pur-
chase of slaves. See Plautus, Captivi iii. 1.

⁴⁴ ——- Aedepol rem meam

constabilivi, quum illos emi de praeda a

quaestoribus.2’

In the preceding line we should certainly
read ‘ Tu si meus esses-’ in preference to
‘ Tu si meus esses ?' which some copies have.
For Demea does not ask a questiom but is
going to threaten Syrus, when he breaks in
and finishes the sentence for him. Demea
afterwards finishes the speech, ⁴ -exemplo
omnibus curarem ut esses! See noto 0¹¹
Eunuchus v. 4. 23.
