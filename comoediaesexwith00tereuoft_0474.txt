Ludis Romanis] The Ludi Romani,
also called the Great Games, Magni, and
the Race-Gavues, Circenses, were celebrated
on the 4th of September, and were dedi-
cated to the great gods Jupiter, Juno, and
Minerva. They were called Circenses be-
cause they consisted chiefly of exhibitions in
the Circus, and so were distinguished from
the Megalensia, in which dramatic exhibi-
tions were the principal part. (See note on
the Inscription to the Andria.) They were
said to have been instituted by Tarquinius
Priscus. These as well as the other games
were celebrated by the aediles. Cicero
speaks of his own services in this way:
“ Nunc sum designatus aedilis: habeo ra-
tionem quid a populo Romano acceperim:
mihi ludos sanctissimos maxima cum cura
et caerimonia Cereri, Libero Liberaeque
faciendos, mihi Floram matrem populo ple-
bique Romanae ludorum celebritate placan-
dam, mihi ludos antiquissimos, qui primi
Romani appellati sunt, cum dignitate maxima

Facta est tv.] C. Fannius Strabo and
M. Valerius Messala were consuls Adi-c.
592, n.c. 161. Commentators have been
perplexed as to the meaning of these words.
We may take them most naturally to mean,
‘ The play was acted a fourth time ς’ whether
it was performed a fourth time in the same
year, or performed at four successive inter-
vals, does not appear. This representation
was in the same year with that of the Eunu-
chus, which was acted five months earlier,
on the 4th of April, at the Megalensia.
