Aer ΙΙΙ. ΒοΕΝΕ III. ‘What am Ι to
do ?’ says Phaedria. ‘ The time is so short,

that it is impossible to get the money. lf duum hoc.'

he had only given me three days, Ι was
promised it.' Antipho consults with Geta.
‘ The money must be found,’ he says, ‘ and
you are the man to find it! Geta with some
reluctance, and only after Phaedria has de-
clai-ed his resolution of following Pamphile.
to the. end of the world, undertakes to
manage the matter for him. Phormio is
the only person who can really help them3
and to him they must go immediately.

,The Metro is trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectic.

2. Quod ei hic potuisset nunc exorarier
triduum hoc] ‘ But if he could only have
been persuaded out of these three days.'
⁴ Exoro' is frequently used with the double
accusative3 as in Plautus, Captivi ii. 1. 17 :
‘⁴ Unum exorare vos sinite nos.¹’ Bacchides

v. 2. 83, 84:

“Hanc veniam illi sine te exorem. Ni.
Ut terebrat ! Satin, offirmatum
Quod mihi erat, id me exorat ?''

Here we have the accusative of the thing
retained in the passive voice. See notes
on Eunuchus, Prol. 17, and Hecyra iv. 4.

23. Bentley alters this line entirely :
⁴ Quod si hinc pote fuisset exorarier tri-
But there is no necessity for
any change. Ι

4. Ut dixti] See iii. 1. 11. Bentley
proposes ‘ quin . . . experimur ?' ⁴ laet us do
our very best to repay him the kindness!
See note on Andria ii. 3. 25. But the text
is supported by all the good authorities ex-
cept the Bembine manuscript, which has
‘experiemur ς’ and this clause must depend
on ⁴ patiemur ’ in the preceding clause.

8. Dictum sapienti sat est] ‘ A word to
the wise.' The proverb is foundin Plautus,
Persa iv. 7. 18.

9. Etiam tu ltine abis Γ] ‘'Pretty nd-
vice yours, indeed. Begone, can't you 2’
For ¹ etiam ’ interrogative, with thaindioe·
tive, see note on Heaut. ii. 2. 6. Compara
Eunuchus iv. 7. 29 ε “ Non tu hinc' abin? ”

10. Non triumpho] ⁸ Can’t 1 cougn-
tulate myself on having got triumphmtly
out of your marriage, but that you must
now order me to look out for fresh punish-
ment in mischief on Phaedria’s account?'
For ⁴ triumpho ' see note on Eunuchus iii.
l. 33 and for ‘crucem' see ii. 3. amorrhis
play, and note. ‘ Nauciscor ' is applied to
barm aswell as to good3 see noteonAndrin
