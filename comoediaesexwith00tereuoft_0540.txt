receive regularly every year two talents of
silver from that property.’ ⁶ Statim’ ori-
ginally means ‘standing,’ as in PlautuS,
Amphitruo i. 1. 85—87 ε
“ Sed fugam in se tamen nemo convertitur ;
Nec recedit loco quin statim rem gerat.
Animam amittunt prius quam loco demi-
grent;”
and v. 120: ‘⁴ Ita statim stant signa, neque
nox. quoquam concedit die‚’' ‘So still do
the constellations stand, nor does night in
any part of the sky give place to day.’ So
it means ‘ on the spot‚' and from this
meaning diverge the ideas, ‘ steadily,' ‘regu-
' larly,’ or ‘ immediately ' (compare ‘ilico ’).
Donatus observes that -in the sense of the
text ‘statim ' has the first syllable long,
in its more common meaning, short. He
is followed by most commentators. See
Quicherat, Thesaurus Poeticus (sub voc.).
He quotes a decisive line in favour of his
view from Ennius :

“Ad terram se prosternunt, statim lacri-
mantes.''

Of the two passages of PlautuS, the latter
proves nothing as to the quantity of the
word, for the first foot of the line may be
either a trochee or a spondee3 and the
former, which is a set of cretio lines, shows
that even in the sense of ‘standing stillss
⁶ steadily‚' it may be short. The line must
be scanned e

We cannot therefore receive the rule without

say ?' ‘ Yes‚' says Nausistrata, ‘and that
when things were far cheaper than they are
now, when the times were not so good for
the farmer to sell his produce! Good times
for the farmer, as she supposes, are when
provisions are at famine prices. In the

10. Parce, sodes] This Nausistrata is . ι

evidently a strong-minded woman. She in
rattling on here at a determined rate, when
Demipho stops her, and advises her fo
spare herself, that she may be able to argue
with Phanium when she goes to see her, or
else she will be beaten bya woman younger
than herself.

15. Jam recte] ‘Nothing at all at pre-

Chremes had nearly betrayed himself when
he first came out of the house, and he now
answers very cautiously, indeed so obscurely
that Demipho cannot for some time take
his hints.
