Adeo depmmm, ut dum vivat meminerit semper mei ;

Qui sibi me pro ridiculo ac delectamento putat.

Non, ita me Di ament, auderet haec facere viduae mulieri, 80
Quae in me fecit.

Ol. Itane tandem quaeso, Menedeme, ut pater

Tam in brevi spatio omnem de me ejecerit animum patris Ρ
Quodnam ob facinus? quid ego tantum sceleris admisi miser P
Vulgo faciunt. Me. Scio tibi esse hoo gravius multo ac durius,
Cui fit ; verum ego haud minus aegre patior. Id qui nescio, 5

80. Viduae mulieri] The word ‘ viduus'
is connected with ‘ idus,’ said to be from the
old Etruscan root, ‘iduo,’ ‘ to divide) Hence
‘ vidua mulier ’ means ‘ a woman sepa-
rated from a man,' one who is in no social

relation to a man. The derivation from-

‘ ve-duo ' after the analogy of ‘ ve-sanus‚'
‘ ve-cors,' &c. is absurd. In legal language
⁴ vidua mulier ' answered to our designation
⁴ femme sole ;’ and did not necessarily imply
that a woman had been married. It is
commonly used in poets even of married
women who are separated from their hus-
bands (see note on Phormio v. 7. 20). The
phrase may be adequately rendered here by
our modern term ‘an unprotected female!
In Plautus, Miles Gloriosus ii. 6. 6-8, we
have a similar complaint:

‘⁸ Non hercle hisce homines me marem sed
foeminam
Vicini rentur esse servi militis:
Ita me ludificant.’'

Aci· V. Semta 11. Clitipho is amazed
when he hears from Menedemus the resolu-
tion to which his father has come. His
fault is a common one; and what can have
induced his father to treat it so severely?
Chremes soon enlightens him on this point.
He informs him that as he had discovered
that he could not control himself, he had
taken care that others should manage his
affairs for him. He has arranged that he
shall not want; but still he shall be depen—

dent on his relations for every thing. This
is better than that Bacchis should get all
that he has. Syrus interposes and begs to
undergo the punishment himself rather than
that Clitipho should suffer for his faults.
Chremes warns him to take care of himself,
and leaves them. Syrus soon eomes to the
rescue with a new expedient. The real
reason for this conduct must be that Clitipho
is not really Chremes’ son: now that Anti· ·
phila has been recovered they throw him
overboard. He advises him to go boldly to
his mother and ask whether this is so or*
no. This will make them ‘explicit with
him, and if it is not so will move their com-
passion. As for himself, the best thing is
to make himself scarce, and to take refuge
with Menedemus.

The Metre is as follows ; 1—26‚ and 45,
trochaic tetrameter catalectic; 48, trochaic
tetrameter3 27-44. 46. 49, iambic tetra-
meter ; 47, iambic tetrameter catalectic.

1.] This line and the last line of the pre-
ceding scene make up a trochaic tetrameter
catalectic.

5. Id qui nescio, nec rationem capio]
This is Bentley’s arrangement, adopted by
Zeune, and seems to give the best sense.
Menedemus says, ‘I know this must be
much hardel· and more difficult for you to
bear, who feel it: but I am not the less
vexed at it. The reason why 1 do not
know and cannot understand: all I know
is that I heartily wish you well! Some
editors arrange it thus: “aegre patior id.
Gt. Qui? (⁴ why do you ?') Me. Nescio,”
&c. But this is rather jejune. ‘Nisi’
is used in many passages of Terence in the
sense of ‘ sed.’ Andria iv. l. 38:
