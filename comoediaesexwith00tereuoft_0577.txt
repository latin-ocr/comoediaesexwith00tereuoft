 

TERENCE AND THE NEW OOMEDY. 503

montaries of Donatus and others. If the detail appears irksome it
must be remembered that it is only by a minute induction such as the
present that we can hope, in the default of the plays themselves of
Menander and Apollodorus, to form any idea of the relations of Terence
to his Greek masters.

In the ‘Annu,’ for instance, Terence not only adopted such por·
tiens of the ‘ Perinthia’ of Menander as suited the general plot of his
play, but, according to the testimony of Donatus, he added the whole
bys-plot, in which Charinus and Byrrhia are actors: “Has personas
Terentius addidit fabulae (nam non sunt apud Menandrum) ne τραγικώ·
τερον fieret, Philumenam spretam relinquere sine sponso, Pamphilo
alium ducente.’' Colman has censured Terence on this very account,
considering that the double plot spoils the unity of the play.
“Charinus‚” he says, “and Byrrhia are but poor counterpnrts or faint
shadows of Pamphilus and Davus3 and instead of adding life and
vigour to the fable, rather damp its spirit, and stop the activity of its
progressss’ Diderot, too, considers that the introduction of this
secondary intrigue rather takes off from the interest of the main plot.
This is one of those points on which every reader may fairly hold his
own opinion. 'To my mind, indeed, the double set of characters is a
great addition to the force of the various situations of the play, to say
nothing of the scenic convenience of a confidant such as Charinus is to
Pamphilus. The despair of both Charinus and Pamphilus, their crossr
purposes, and their common indignation against Davus, or admiration of
him, as circumstances favour the one feeling or the other, could not
well be spared from the ‘ Andria.’ What, however, I would notice
here is, that we have in this case an important instance of the variation
which Terence allowed himself from the original from which he was
working. He is generally aecused of too literal and meagre an imita-
tion. This example, at all events, shows positive invention united with
great art in the construction of his play. We can hardly fancy that the
‘Andria’ of Menander was so plastic as to permit two new characters
to be foisted into the plot without any disturbance of the order of the
dialogus or the sequence of eventu and 1 should certainly claim for
Terence in this particular case something more than the originality of a
compilet. He cannot simply have dovetailed his new matter into the
oxi-cing plot. He must to a great extent bave recast tho whole.

Passing on to the ‘ Eunuolms ’ we find one or two trifling alterations
in addition to the general change of plot, which consisted in the intro-
ductiones the characters of the Braggadocio and Parasite srom the ‘ Co·
lax' of Menander. See above, p. 492. Thus we have the change of names
in the opening scene, the introduction of the character of Antipho in
Act iii. Sernes 4 and 6, to avoid the awkwardness of the soliloquy in
