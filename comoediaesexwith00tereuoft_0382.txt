Aer V. Scmm ΙΙΙ. Micio, coming from
Sostrata's house, where he has been to make
arrangements for the marriage of Aeschinus
61111 Pamphila, falls 111 with Demea, who is
coming out of his house, having just dis-
covered Ctesipho in high revel with the
music girl. The two brothers now come
to an explanation. Demea complains that
Micio supplies both his sons with the
means of vice and extravagance. He an-
swers, ‘You, Demea, at 0116 time took
care of both; and you made money for
both. Do the same now. Save your money
for them; and let them spend mine. In
the mean time, we must make allowance
sor the difference of their characters, and
not be too 811101 with them. At all events
be indulgent to-day, while your son is being
married. After that, do 68 you like!
‘WelL' says Demea, ‘as soon as it is over
Ι will be off to my farm with my son, and
1 will take 0616 11161 11118 girl of his has
some work to do which will very soon spoil
her beauty! ⁶ 80 be it,’ says Micio, ‘ mean-
while let us enjoy ourselvae to-day.'

The Metro is iambic trimeter.

3. Quid clamem aut querar 2’] For ‘ cla-

mo' see iv. 7. 9.
6. Sue-currendum est] ‘There isa quar-
rel forthcoming. Ι 1111181 10 1116 1680116] ’

8. Ad le redi] Compare Andria iii. 5. 16:
“ Siue paululum ad me redeam.”

10. Rem ipsam putemus] ⁴ Let us look
the matter fairly in 1116 face! ¹ Putare ' is
used sometimes in the sense of ‘ 10 keep
accounts! See note on ii. l. 54, and so too
it means ⁴ to examine into a 11161161,’ “ 10 go
into an affair!

truo ii. l. 48:

‘⁴ Quo id, malum, pacto potest nam (me-
cum argumentis puta)
Fieri nunc uti tu hic sis et domi ?”

Compare Plautus, Amphi-

14. Numqui minus] Bentley proposes to
read ⁴ Numqui minus Mihi jus idem sit
tecum, quod mecum est mihi ?' He oon·
siders that ‘ tecum ' is required by the anti·
thesis. But this is a mere conjecture.
⁴ Num qui ' 18 1116 reading of the best autho-

rities. It should be written ‘ numqui ' after . ² ’

1116 analogy of ‘ numquis,’ ⁴ numquid!
The sense is, ‘ Is there any reason why it is

not fair that Ι should have the same rights as
you have ?'
