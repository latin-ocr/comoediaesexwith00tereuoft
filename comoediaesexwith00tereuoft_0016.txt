have thrown my remarks into a shape of my own, the scholar will
see that I have not sought to disguise my obligations to these and
other writers on Latin Versification. The whole subject has been
much neglected3 and is so important, perhaps even with a view
to the future settlement of the text of Terence, that I-make no
apology for having entered into it fully.

The Fragments of Menander and other Greek authors have been
frequently noticed in the course of the notes. But for the sake of
the student I have brought together in an Excursus at the end of '
the volume all the undoubted passages of Menander and Apollo—
dorus which may be referred to the plays imitated by Terence ;
and Ι have at the same time considered the general question of the
relation of Terence to his Greek predecessors.

At the risk of increasing slightly the bulk of the volume Ι have
added an Index of the Latinity of Terence, which will, I trust, be
considered an addition to the usefulness of the book. This Index
is based on that in Giles’ edition of Zeune before spoken of ; but I
found it necessary to make innumerable alterations, erasurOS‚ and ,
additions, so that the Index is to all intents and purposes a new
one.

I have acknowledged my obligation to other editors whenever I
have taken from them quotations which were evidently their own. ,
Every classical author is, however, overlaid with a mass of illus-
trative matter which may be considered the common property of
commentators. Of all editors of Terence perhaps most is due in
this way to Westerhovius 'and Lindenbrog. To avoid unne-

cessary length I have often referred the reader to the Dictionary of
Antiquities edited by Dr. Smith.
