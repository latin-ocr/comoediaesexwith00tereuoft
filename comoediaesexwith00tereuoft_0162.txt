88 EUNUOHUS.

Infecta pace, ultro ad eam venies, indicans
Te amare et ferre non posse, actum est : ilicet:

Peristi.

Eludet, ubi te victum senserit. 10

Proin tu dum est tempus etiam atque etiam cogita,

Here, quae res in se neque eonsih'um neque modum

Habet ullum eam consilio regere non potes.

In amore haec omnia insunt vitia ; injuriae,

Suspiciones, inimicitiae, indutiae, ἢ 15
Bellum, pax rursum. Incerta haec si tu postules ¹
Ratione certa facere, nihilo plus agas

Quam si des operam ut cum ratione insanias.

Et quod nunc tute tecum iratus cogitas,

“ Egone illam quae illum? quae me Ρ quae non P sine modo :p 20

9. Actum est.- ilicet] ‘ It is all over with
you; you may take yourself off! For ‘actum
est ⁹ see note on Andria iii. l. 7. ‘ Ilicet '
was a word in very common use at all
public ceremonies‚ signifying that business
was over, that the audience or spectators
might depart. It retains this meaning in
Plautus and Terence, when affairs are
spoken of as desperate. Thus in Phormio
i. 4. 31 e “ Hoc nihil est, Phaedria. Ilicet.
Quid hic conterimus operam frustra?’'
Compare also below ii. 3. 55 ι “ Ilicet,
desine: jam conclamatum est.'' It is de-
rived from ‘ire licet‚' after the analogy of
‘ scilicet ’ (scire licet), and ⁴ videlicet' (videre
licet). It is sometimes used in the sense of
an indignant farewell, as in Plautus, Cap-
tivi iii. 1. 9: “ Ilicet parasiticae arti maxi-
mam in malam crucem!” where it is in
construction with the dative case.

10. Eludet, ubi te victum senserit] ‘ She
will mock you when she sees that you are
beaten! This is the most simple transla-
tion οῖ ‘ eludet ' in this passage. Donatus
explains it thus: “ Eludere proprie gladia-
torum est cum vicerint—et eludere est finem
ludo imponere.’' In that sense the passage
would mean, ,² She will have done with you.’
‘Eludere’ again means to parry a blow,
as in Martial xiv. 202: “ Callidus emissas
eludere simius hastas.’' ‘ She will content
herself with keeping you at a distance when
she sees that you are conquered.' All
these meanings enter into the idea of the
passage. The young man's mistress de-
lights in the sport of conquest, and when
her conquest is made, she does not care to
continue the game, but dismisses her fallen
antagonist with derision.

15. Indutiae]
swers to the Greek ἁνακωχὴ, a temporary

‘ Truces! The word an- ⁷

suspension of hostilities, as opposed to a
lasting peace. The derivation of the word
is doubtful. For a more amusing catalogue
of the inconveniencies of love see Plautus,
Mercator, Prolog. vv. 18-36, where among
other humorous points the following plagues
are attributed to the deity:

“ Insomnia‚ aerumna, error, terror, et fuga,
Ineptia stultitiaque adeo et temeritas,
Incogitantia, excors immodestia,
Petulantia, cupiditas, malevolentia;
Inhaeret aviditas, desidia, injuria,

Inopia, contumelia et dispendium,
Multiloquium, pauciloquium.”

The reader should particularly look at the
ingenious explanation of the last two qua-
lities. Horace paraphrases these lines of
Terence closely, dilating a little on the
word ‘ incerta,’ Sat. ii. 3. 267—271 z

In amore haec sunt mala,

 

pagelffsshm : haec si quis tempestatis
prope ritu

Mobilia et caeca fluitantia sorte laboret

Reddere certa sibi, nihilo plus explicet

Iiiffslgnsiie paret certa ratione modoque.”

20. Eyone illam quae illum 7] ⁸ shall 1
go to her who has preferred him? who
has expelled me? who has not admitted
me? Let me alone for that.’' The simple
elliptical expressions of this line do not
require detailed notice. For the use of
‘sine modo’ compare iv. 6. 1: “Sine
veniat,’' and Plautus, Asinaria v. 2. 48:

‘⁴ Sine venias modo domum ε faxo ut scias
Quid pericli sit dotatae uxori vitium di-
cere.
