26 ANDRIA.

Pa. Memor essem? o Mysis Mysis, etiam nunc mihi
Scripta illa sunt in animo diota. Chrysidis

De Glycerio.

J am ferme moriens me vocat ι

Accessi ε vos semotae: nos soli z incipit: 50
“ Mi Pamphile, hujus formam atque aetatem vides ε

Ν80 clam te est quam illi utraeque res nunc utiles

Et ad pudicitiam et ad rem tutandam sient.

Quod ego te per hanc dextram oro et ingenium tuum,

Per tuam fidem, perque hujus solitudinem, 55
Te obtestor, ne abs te hanc segreges neu deseras,

Si te in germani fratris dilexi loco,

Sive haec te solum semper fecit maximi,

Seu tibi morigera fuit in rebus omnibus.

Te isti virum do amioum tutorem patrem. 60
Bona nostra haec tibi permitto et tuae mando fidei.''

Hanc mihi in manum dat: mors continuo ipsam occupat.

51. Hujus formam]
‘This girl that belongs to mel
in the next line may be translated ‘that
poor girl ;' and would naturally be spoken
aside even if she were present, which is not
necessarily implied in ‘ hujus!

52. Quam illi utraeque res· nunc utiles]
‘And you well know how far both kinds of
qualities are fit to preserve her character
and her position! The conjunctive shows
that ‘ utiles ' is the correct reading. It

‘ Hujus ’ means
‘ Illi ’

insinuates the contrary, rat-ber than states
it as a fact. ⁴ Utraeque res' is here used
rather irregularly for ‘utraque harum re-
rum! The plural would naturally signify
that we are speaking of two classes of per-
sons or things, as in Heaut. ii. 4. 14 : ‘⁴ Hoc
beneficio utrique ab utrisque vero devinci-

' mini;'' namely, ‘ such as you,' and ‘such

as your lovers.’ For ‘utraeque res nunc
utiles ⁷ Weise reads ‘ nunc utraeque in-
utiles‚' not on good authority. I have
therefore restored the common text of good
editions and MSS„ which gives an ironical
meaning to ‘utiles‚' better suited to the
spirit of the. passage. 4 Pudicitiam ¹ is pro-
nounced 4 puditiam,' as'is often the case
with ‘ amicitia ' and ‘inimicitia (see Intro-
duction .

54. guod eqo te per hanc dextram] Bent-
ley altered this line to ‘ Quod te ego per dex-
tram hanc oro et per genium tuum! Com-

. pare virg. Aen. ii. 141 ε “ Quod te per supe-

ros.'' So in Hor. Epist. i. 7. 94, where he
seems to allude to this passage, ‘⁸ Quod te
‘per genium, dextramque deosque penates,”
where see Macleane's note on the word

4 genius! But the line is satisfactory as it
stands, though it does not square so well
with the passage in Horace.

56. Abs· te hanc seyreyes] So Plaut.
Captivi iii. l. 10: “ Ita juventus jam ri-
diculos inopes abs se segregat.” Heaut. ii.
4. 6 : “Volgus quae abs se segregant.''

57. Germani] Of brothers and sisters who
have the same parent& or at least the same
father or mother. Generally in sense of
4 real.’ Plaut. Mat. i. 1. 39.

59. Moriyerasuit] Equivalent to 4 Μο-
rem gessit.’ “

60. Te isti viru-m do] ⁴1 give you to her
now that she is yours.' We may remark
the nicety with which Terence used the
personal pronouns. Chrysis had first spoken
of Pasibula as belonging to her3 theu
having to hint at possible misfortune she
spoke of her as absent, or perhaps lite-
rally spoke aside. She then resumes the
former pronoun, continuing to speak of her
as her own, and now finally, commending
her to Pamphilus, treats her as his (see
the note on v. 51- 53).

62. Hanc milti in manum dat] ‘She
gives her into my charge.’ This is more
natural than to suppose, with Donatus, that
the marriage 4 per conventionem in manum ⁹
is here intended. See Quintilian v. lo.
Terence would be more likely to speak in
general terms than to introduce a techni-
cality of Roman law, which is hardly in
keepmg with the Greek colouring of his
play throughout. See notes on i. 3. 16,
and i. l. 42.
