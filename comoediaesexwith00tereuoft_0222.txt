9. Incedere] ⁴ Here I see Parmeno, that
excellent person, strutting along. See, in
the name of goodness, how leisurely he
takes it !’ ⁴ Incedo ' carries with it the idea
of ease and dignity.' See Virgil, Aen. i. 46:

“ Ast ego quae divum incedo regina ;'⁷

and Propertius ii. 2. 5:

“Fulva coma est, longaeque manus, et
maxima toto

Corpore ξ, et incedit vel Jove digna
soron

and iv. 12. (13.) ll (Weise):
“ Matrona incedit census induta nepotum.'’

The expression ‘ si Dis placet ’ is used indig-
nantly again in Adelphi iii. 4. 30:

“Ille bonus vir nobis psaltriam, si Dis
, Ραξὲζξξῖᾆιιὶωω vivat : illam deserit.”

Acr V. Scnnn IV. Parmeno congratu-
lates himself upon the service he has done
to Chaerea. For he has not only put him
in the way of obtaining the object of his
love without any difficulty, though it ap-
peared next to impossible, but he has also
enabled him to obtain an insight into the
private life of these gay ladies, who are
attractive only when not-well-known3 and
so has done him a real service. And of all
this the eredit will be Parmeno’s. Pythias
interrupte these pleasant thoughts by break-
ing out into a lamentation over Chaerea’s
wretched fate. He has outraged an Athe-
nian citizen3 and is now about to suffer

the due punishment of his mime- Par-
meno is thrown into the most unbounded
consternation, and sees no help for it but to
tell his old master Laches, the father of
Phaedria and Chaerea, from whom he has

nothting to expect but summary punish-
men .

The Metre is as follows; 1—20, iambic
trimeter 3 21—48‚ trochaic tetrameter cata-
lectic.

4. Nam ut . . . dispendio] These lines,
and indeed the whole passage to v. 18, are
much involved in construction. Parmeno
is made to touch upon each subject first,
and then to enlarge upon it, which neces-
sarily leads to some awkwardness of con-
struction. Donatus remarks: ‘⁸ Quum di-
cere deberet quod ei amorem et difficillimum
et carissimum confeci .- primo quasi oblitus
dicti superioris, transit ad virginem: deinde
addit causam ex abundanti '’ (namely in
the words ⁴ a meretrice avara'). There is
no doubt that the text is genuine, though
Eugraphius has ⁶ eum ' -but who is to an-
swer for his text ?-—and we may translate
it with a slight paraphrase, so as to preserve
its form. ‘ To say nothing of this, that, in
the matter of 8 love affair which was most
difficult and expensive, nothing less than to
snatch a girl whom he loved from arape-
cious courtezan, 1 placed her in his power
without difficulty, cost, and loss: there re-
mains besides this second point, which in-

deed is to my mind my prime invention, to ,-

have put the young man in the way of knowing
the characters and ways of these courtezans,

that when he knows them well, he may for
ever eschew them.
