position is confirmed by the fact of his intimacy with Scipio and Laelius,
who must have treated him as an equal rather than as a dependent for
the story to have gained ground that he was indebted to them for the
language and composition of his plays. Even if we suppose Terence to
have been a foreigner and a freedman, yet we must conclude that his
circumstances were easy, or at all events sufficiently independent to enable
him to be chary ,of his reputation and fastidious in his style. Poor
authors do not generally set themselves against the prevailing *taste of
their times. Terence was evidently well educated and refined3 and
though this may be attributed exclusively to his natural genius, yet to
indulge his literary tastes and to carry out his own idea of dramatic
composition, which was an innovation upon the practice of his prede-
cessors in the Roman Drama, he must have been independent of public
approva13 he must have been able to despise the clap-trap artifices of
the popular play-mongers, and to wait his time, elaborating his diction
and his verse, and working out his pieces after the model of hin favourite
Greek masters ¹.

The universal testimony of antiquity makes Terence to have written
six comedies, and six only. Of the existing plays the ‘ Andria' seems
certainly to have been the earliest, and the ‘ Adelphi’ the latest3 nor
have we any intimation of any other plays but those which we possess.
The perfect state of all the plays of Terence—a question which is
quite distinct from that of the text—and the possibility of verifying
all'existing'quotations by the extant playS, lead ‚us to conclude that
we are in possession of all that Terence wrote. It has, however,
been argued with some plausibility that the ‘ Andria' was not the first
play brought before the public by Terence, and that there must doubtless
have been other occasions on which he appeared as an author, and
previous attacks of his antagonists which he had been obliged to answer.
, This supposition gains colour from the following passages. For in the
Prologue to the ‘ Andria ’ he says:

“ Nam in prologis scribendis operam abutitur, -
Non qui argumentum narret, sed qui malevoli
Veteris poetae maledictis respondeat.'’ (vv. 5-7.)

Here the poet seems certainly to be speaking generally, as if he was
