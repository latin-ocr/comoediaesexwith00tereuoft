desii-ed effect, recourse was had to another. We shall consider them
briefly in order.

Thai: which meets us first, and is noticed in the Prologue to the
‘Andria‚' is the charge of Plagiarism. This constituted the most im-
portant count of the indictment against Terence3 and he answers it

¹ with a care which shows that he attached some weight to it. If we

examine his answer, we find that the plays of Greek writers had all
along been considered as the common property of Roman playwrights.
Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, he says, had done the same ; and he was
content to err in such good company. Moreover his opponent, Lavinius,
is convicted of having used more than one of Menander’s plays at all
events, and very badly too, making some capital blunders in law and

· manners. Terence’s own case is fully considered in the ‘Excursus ’ at

the end of this volume, in which I examine carefully the extent of his
obligations to Menander and Apollodorus, and inquire how far we may
allow him to have had the originality of an independent poet. Here

⁴ I may say generally that, as a matter of fact, he appears to have used

the common Greek materials without scruple‚ accommodating them to
his own design. It does not follow from this that 116 was a servile
translator. His faithful adherence in the main to his originals, without
any introduction of Roman wit and manners, was, as has been shown,

’ the effect of his principles of composition. To civilize Roman taste by

Greek literature, he must avoid the mixture of the ordinary Roman
style. He is also accused of an imitation of his Roman predecessors.
This he entirely disclaims, as in the Prologue to the ‘Eunuchus.’
Lavinius had said:

“ Colacem esse Naevi et Plauti veterem fabulam3
Parasiti personam inde ablatam et militis.’'

(vv. 24, 26.)

“ Si id est peccatum, peccatum imprudentia est
Poetae; non qui furtum facere studuerit.”
(vv. 27, 28.)

‘ Colax ’ of Menander, he adds:
