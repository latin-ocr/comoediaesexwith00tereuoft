22 ANDRIA.

Civem Atticam esse hanc.

Fuit olim hinc quidam senex,

Mercator : navem is fregit apud Andrum insulam ε

Is obiit mortem: ibi tum hanc ejectam Chrysidis

Patrem recepisse orbam, parvam : Fabulae.

Mihi quidem hercle non fit verisimile ; atque ipsis commentum

placet.

Sed Mysis ab ea egreditur: at ego hinc me ad forum ut
Conveniam Pamphilum, ne de hac re pater imprudentem op-

primat.

AOTUS PRIMI SOENA QUARTA.

MYSIS.

Audivi Archylis jamdudum :

Lesbiam adduci jubes.

Sane pol illa temulenta est mulier et temeraria,
Nec satis digna cui committas primo partu mulierem3

16. Civem Atticam] For if this could
be proved Pamphilus would be obliged to
marry her (iv. 4. 41). In order to con-
stitute this claim, it was necessary that both
her parents should have been citizens.
Compare Act v. sc. 3. 8, 9, and Dictionary
of Antiquifies, art. ‘ Civitas,' p. 289.

19. Fabulae] ‘Nonsense.’ For another
sense of the word, see note on iv. 4. 8.

20. Mihi quidem hercle] ‘ Quidem ' is
here entirely elided before ‘hercle‚’ as is
often the case 111 this phrase. So Eun.
i. 1. 5: ‘⁴ Si quidem hercle possis nil prius
neque fortius ;'' Plautus, Trin. i. 2. 20:
‘⁴ Dum quidem hercle tecum nupta sit sane
velim ;’' and other passages. It is often
pronounced as a monosyllable without any
elision. Below, Act ii. sc. 2. 10, the last
syllable only is elided z “ Mea quidem
, hercle certe in dubio vita est. Da. Et quid
tu scio ;'' and in Phormio i. 3. 12 ε “ Nam
tua quidem hercle certe vita haec expetenda
optandaque est.” ‘ Atque ’ is equivalent to
‘and yet,' as in iii. 5, 8: “Nec quid me
(faciam scio) ε atque id ago sedulo.''

21. qu hinc me (conferam) ad sorum]
Compare Eun. v. 2. 5: ‘⁶ Ubi vidi, ego me
hinc in pedes quantum que0,'' &c. Davus
hopes to meet Pamphilus in the Forum.
It was the usual lounge of young men about
town. See Plautum, Capt. iii. 1. 18; “Nam
ut dudum licere abivi accessi ad adulescentes
in foro.”

Ac¹r Ι. scanz 4. Τ110 first six verses of ‘he was always a cross-grainedold feuowe ’

this scene are trochaic tetrameters; the re-
mainder iambic tetrameters. Mysis is here
introduced that we may be prepared for her
appearance in the next scene. She enters,
speaking to a servant within the house.
We must remember that the stage-seenery of
comedy consisted simply of a street eeene3
on each side houses, the doors opening out-
wards on the street. An altar stood on
each side3 one dedicated to Bacchus, the
other to the god of the current festival.

l. Lesbiam] There is no necessity for
connecting this name with Lesbius wine,
as is done by some laborious commentators.
In most editions we meet with a good deal
of perverted ingenuity in the explanation of
the names of the different characters. But
this kind of criticism may be dispensed with.
The subject of the' names of the Dramafis
Personae has been discussed in the Intro·
duction.

2. temulenta . . . compotrix] See Hor.
Epist. i. 13. 14 : “Ut vinosa glomus
furtivae Pyrrhia lanae.’' Hospita-1 musea
and midwives have always enjoyed this un·
enviable notoriety.

The phrase ‘importunitatem spectate
aniculae ’ has given needless trouble. It
simply means, ‘You see how the old hag
bothers me, because the other is her pot
companion.⁷ ‘ Importunus ' literally means
‘out of place,' ¹ out of season,’ and hence
6110111110001110,1 ‘vexatiousl Compare Heaut.
i. 2. 23 ι “ Senex fuit importunus semper,”
